<h3>Disputes about accidents or injuries – a guide</h3>
<p>If you’ve been hurt in an accident that was someone else’s fault, you may be entitled to compensation. Most claims are settled out of court, but you may need legal help and advice. Find out what you can do if you’ve suffered a personal injury.</p>
<h3>Working out if someone else is to blame</h3>
<p>You won’t always be entitled to compensation if you’ve been hurt in an accident.</p>
<p>You might have been hurt as a result of:</p>
<ul>
<li>slipping up in a supermarket</li>
<li>a road traffic accident</li>
<li>an accident at work</li>
<p>In each case, you’d have to be able to show that the accident could have been avoided if someone else had taken reasonable care.<br>
They could be to blame if they failed to clean up a spillage in the supermarket, or if they drove carelessly on the road.</p>
<h3>Reporting the injury</h3>
<p>Get medical help, even if the accident doesn’t seem serious, as it could get worse later on. Call 082911 if it’s an emergency, or see your GP.</p>
<ul>
<li>if it is a road accident, report it to the police and your insurance company if you’re a driver</li>
<li>if it is a work accident, record it in the work accident book or report it to your employer</li>
<li>if you slip up in a shop, report the accident to the manager</li>
<p>You should also get evidence, such as photos of the injury or the scene of the accident, or names and addresses of witnesses.</p>

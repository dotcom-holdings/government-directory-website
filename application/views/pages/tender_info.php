<div class="subheading"><strong>WHAT IS A TENDER OR BID?</strong></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;
	</p><p>A tender is an offer to do work or supply goods at a fixed price. Getting goods or services is also known as "procurement". Since January 2004, government began referring to tenders as "bids". When government "puts out a tender" or "invites bids", this means government asks the public for price offers to do work or supply goods. Government then assesses who to choose based on the prices offered and the nature of the person or company making the tender.</p>
<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tender or bid process is designed to ensure that the work to be done for government is given out in a fair way. There are a number of policies (known as "procurement policies") with special mention of the <a href="https://www.westerncape.gov.za/Text/2010/7/preferential_procurement_policy_framework_act_5_of_2000.pdf" target="_blank">Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act (PPPFA)</a> that guides government on how to make decisions on which tender to accept. Although price is very important in the decision on which tender or bid to accept, it is not the only factor taken into account.</p>

<p>Once government accepts a tender, it is binding on both parties. This means that the person or company that won the tender has to provide the goods or services in the manner agreed to and at the price offered, and government must pay the agreed price at the agreed time. In other words, once accepted, a tender is a binding contract.</p>

<div class="subheading"><strong>WESTERN CAPE SUPPLIER DATABASE</strong></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;
	</p><p>The Western Cape Provincial Government also has a contract with Quadrem/TradeWorld to populate and maintain a supplier database, called the Western Cape Supplier Database (WCSD) which can be requested by e-mail: <a href="mailto:supplierdatabase@quadrem.com">supplierdatabase@quadrem.com</a>. This <a href="http://pawc1i.epsi.co.za/login/login.asp" target="_blank">database</a> is shared with the City of Cape Town.</p>
<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Registration on the <a href="http://www.tradeworld.net" target="_blank">Western Cape Supplier Database</a> (accessed through Tradeworld) is without charge. At the moment, being on the database does NOT mean you will have tenders (RFQs) sent to you. It is a means of helping to verify who you are, speeds up the whole tender process, and is required in order for you to be compliant to do business with the entities that own and share the database.</p>

<p>This shared database serves as the registration base for all suppliers wishing to conduct business with both the City of Cape Town and Provincial Government of the Western Cape.</p>

<p>That is, suppliers register ONCE on this database to do business with both parties, even if previously registered on one of their existing databases. If you are already registered with the City of Cape Town, you do not need to re-register. In order to be registered and approved on the Western Cape Supplier Database free of charge, please collect a registration form from:</p>

<ul><li>5th Floor, Tower Block, Civic Centre, Hertzog Boulevard, Cape Town</li>
	<li>Provincial Treasury, 3rd Floor, 15 Wale Street, Cape Town.</li>
	<li>Western Cape Supplier Database Call Centre at 0861 225 577 or e-mail at <a href="mailto:supplierdatabase@quadrem.com">supplierdatabase@quadrem.com</a></li>
</ul><p>Alternatively, prospective tenderers can download the Western Cape Supplier Database (WCSD) <a href="https://www.westerncape.gov.za/assets/departments/economic-development-tourism/wcsd_form_2016.pdf" target="_blank">registration form</a> or visit the Quadrem/TradeWorld website, <a href="http://www.tradeworld.net" target="_blank">http://www.tradeworld.net</a>.

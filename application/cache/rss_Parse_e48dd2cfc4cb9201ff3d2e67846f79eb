<p>This interchange is designed to provide continuous access to the Verulam, Phoenix, Mount Edgecombe, uMhlanga Ridge Town Centre and the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast.</p>
<p>Corné Roux, the Eastern Region project manager for SANRAL said that the biggest challenge was accommodating the traffic during construction.</p>
<p>“The interchange sits on a major national road, the N2, and the M41 feeds major residential, industrial and commercial areas such as Phoenix, Mt Edgecombe and uMhlanga carrying high volumes of traffic which had to be kept moving during the interchange’s construction,&#8221; said Roux.</p>
<p>He added that another challenge was the ground conditions that needed the installation of extensive piling to support the interchange structures.</p>
<p>Despite the lengthy construction period and disruptions on this busy stretch of road, motorists are now feeling the benefits of the interchange which has dramatically improved traffic flow through the area.</p>
<p>The new roads have state-of-the-art lighting making the intersection safer and more visible at night while the pedestrian bridge also makes it safer and more convenient for people to cross the N2.</p>
<p>According to Roux, the Mount Edgecombe Interchange is now a landmark structure and an important artery of the greater eThekwini metropolitan highway system for easing traffic, relieving congestion and is also a significant business enabler.</p>
<p>Managing Director of Tongaat Hulett Developments Michael Deighton said, “Not only has the new interchange improved driving conditions in this previously congested area but it will also unlock significant development opportunities planned for the KwaZulu-Natal north coast&#8221;.</p>

<p>Pietermaritzburg student designer Nosipho Ntuli staved off what could have been a DUT clean-sweep by securing a top ten spot, but the judges conceded afterwards that it had been very tough to separate the top ten from the thirty semi-finalists.</p>
<p>Judges Terrence Bray, Kathrin Kidger, Sindi Shangase, Zama Mathe and Derrick Mhlongo deliberated for some time before settling on the top ten and concluded that the overall quality of the entries made for a long deliberation over the top 10.</p>
<p>“What was notable was that the standard of entries was consistently high, which makes it tougher for the judges,”’ said Bray.</p>
<p>“In line with where fashion is going, the designs were very individual and very well considered and thoughtful,” he added. “The judges tended to favour ideas and designs that we have never seen before. That’s the nature of the competition.”</p>
<p>Bray said that many of the most striking designs were menswear.</p>
<p>“I will be very surprised if we don’t see a menswear winner from this year’s finalists. They were head-and-shoulders above the ladies wear,” said Bray.</p>
<p>“We were all pleasantly surprised. The menswear was creatively very strong and very polished.</p>
<p>“There will be a new panel of judges from here, and who knows, they may see things differently!” he added.</p>
<p>The ten finalists go through to the two evenings of high fashion at the Vodacom Durban July Fashion Showcase at Greyville Racecourse on Thursday and Friday evenings, where another panel of expert judges will study the top ten student designers’ work and decide on the top three, which will only be revealed on the day of the Vodacom Durban July, Saturday 7 July.</p>
<p>Tickets are still available for the two Vodacom Durban July Fashion Showcase shows on Thursday and Friday, Online bookings are through the event website.</p>
<p>The ten finalists are Nosipho Ntuli (Pietermaritzburg School of Fashion), Chané Lange, Siphiwo Mkhwanazi, Nhlosenhle Cele, Tebogo Mokgope, Andile Nsele, Minenhle Memela, Mhlengi Mngoma, Georgina Brink, Gracious Lubisi (Durban University of Technology)</p>

<p>Last year on TAB alone, about R138 million was bet on the race and that does not include what was spent with bookmakers and office pools around the country.</p>
<p>This year, those going into their local tote will discover they have a number of betting options on the race over 2 200m at Greyville Racecourse that carries a stake of R4.25 million.</p>
<p>Of course, there is the normal win and place bet but remember TAB will be paying a place dividend for the first six runners past the post.</p>
<p>Then there are exactas where you have to pick the first two past the post in the exact order, a trifecta that asks you to predict the first three past the post in the correct order and finally you have the quartet, where you have to find the first four runners past the post in the correct order.</p>
<p>This year, R1.2-million will be added to the quartet pool which is expected to reach R16 million. Catch a share of that pool and it will be a big payday.</p>
<p>Remember, in the case of the trifecta and quartet, you are allowed to take a percentage of the bet, which makes it affordable to everybody.</p>
<p>Last year there was a dead heat for fourth place and as a result, there were two dividends. The first paid R9 406 and the second R7 004. Depending on how you took your quartet, there is a possibility you could have caught both.</p>
<p>Then there are other bets like the pick 6, in which you need to find the winners of races four to nine.</p>
<p>That is another massive pool which is expected to reach R13 million and probably a lot more. Once again, one is permitted to take a percentage of the full bet.</p>
<p>There are a number of other bets available such as swingers, where you need to find two horses who finish in the first three. It makes no difference in what order they finish.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<img width="210" height="158" src="http://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ushaka-210x158.jpg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="" style="float: left; margin-right: 5px;" /><p>uShaka Marine World, Africa’s largest marine theme park and an integral part of the city’s overall tourism offering, was recently announced as the winner of KZN’s Top Brand 2018 at the Standard Bank Top Business Awards.</p>
<p>The announcement made recently at a Gala Dinner hosted at the Elangeni Hotel is testament to the fact that uShaka Marine World is not only an engine for growth and redevelopment within the city’s Point Waterfront precinct but also an economic success in its own right.</p>
<p>CEO for uShaka Marine World, Mrs Stella Khumalo, said that being chosen above respected consumer brands such as  Defy, MCS, Gagasi FM, The Sharks, Blue Security, BB Bakeries, Hilton Durban, Coastlands Hotel, KZN Oils, aQuellé , FMI, DRG Outsourcing, Boxer Superstores, Edison Power, 1st Call Group as well as East Coast Radio was a significant honour.</p>
<p>uShaka was created over 14 years ago to kick start urban regeneration and boost for development in an area of Durban’s beachfront that was previously ignored. As a result, it has enabled the creation and growth of related hospitality businesses and contributed towards the overall growth of tourism in the city and the province as a whole.</p>
<p>Khumalo said that uShaka prided itself in offering a combination of entertainment and outdoor leisure activities that are suitable for all ages and are aimed at both the international and domestic tourism markets. Attractions include water slides at Wet ‘n Wild, sea animal interactions as uShaka Sea Animal Encounter Island, dolphin and seal shows, the Dangerous Creatures exhibit, the Chimp &#38; Zee Rope Adventure Park, as well as an attraction for children aged 2 to 12 years at uShaka Kids World.

<p>The announcement made recently at a Gala Dinner hosted at the Elangeni Hotel is testament to the fact that uShaka Marine World is not only an engine for growth and redevelopment within the city’s Point Waterfront precinct but also an economic success in its own right.</p>

<p>uShaka was created over 14 years ago to kick start urban regeneration and boost for development in an area of Durban’s beachfront that was previously ignored. As a result, it has enabled the creation and growth of related hospitality businesses and contributed towards the overall growth of tourism in the city and the province as a whole.</p>
<p>Khumalo said that uShaka prided itself in offering a combination of entertainment and outdoor leisure activities that are suitable for all ages and are aimed at both the international and domestic tourism markets. Attractions include water slides at Wet ‘n Wild, sea animal interactions as uShaka Sea Animal Encounter Island, dolphin and seal shows, the Dangerous Creatures exhibit, the Chimp &amp; Zee Rope Adventure Park, as well as an attraction for children aged 2 to 12 years at uShaka Kids World.

<p>Hundreds of residents went on the rampage after a man was shot dead on the Gqobhokani farm.</p>
<p>According to police, on Wednesday two young men, one of them being 30-year-old Spamandla Xulu, were fishing at a dam on the Gqobhokani farm.</p>
<p>The men were confronted by a security guard who requested that they leave. An altercation ensued which led to the guard allegedly fatally shooting Xulu. The second man escaped uninjured.</p>
<p>The security guard has since been arrested on a charge of murder and is currently in police custody.</p>
<p>“The man suspected of killing Mr Xulu has been arrested and members of the community should allow the law to take its course,” General Sitole said.</p>
<p>Community members took to the streets initially setting tyres alight on the R66 road and later burning down the Gqobhokani farm house, his sugarcane plantation as well as at least two neighbouring plantations.</p>
<p>“Destroying property is no solution to any problem but rather it is a crime which is punishable by law. Furthermore, it serves to neither help nor corrects any situation,” said General Sitole.</p>
<p>He has tasked the Provincial Commissioner to mobilise an investigative task team to look into the burning of the farmhouse and farms and bring those responsible to book as “such behaviour is criminal and unacceptable”.</p>
<p>Members of the Public Order Police Unit, Tactical Response Team and members of the local police stations have been mobilised to stabilise the area.</p>

<p>The Durban Regional Court on Monday heard his version that he had only consumed four cider drinks during that evening although at one stage &#8220;other patrons&#8221; at the bar had split drinks on him.</p>
<p>He also denied any negligence claiming that he was driving home at about 05:00 when he heard a &#8220;loud bang&#8221; and his windscreen shattered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I braked and moved towards the left in order to stop and moments later heard another bang. I could not see properly out of my smashed windscreen,&#8221; he said in a written explanation of his not guilty plea which was read into the record by his advocate Murray Pitman.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not see the cyclists prior to hitting them. I did not expect them on the road at all because the M4 is a freeway which prohibits bicycles.”</p>
<p>Monday saw the start of the long-awaited five-day trial before Magistrate Anand Maharaj in which Ramnarain, a 33-year-old plumber, is accused of culpable homicide for the deaths of Richard Da Silva, 46, and his friend and cycling partner Jared Dwyer, 36.</p>
<p>The pair were on an early morning ride with a group of cyclists when they were struck by Ramnarain’s black Golf GTI. They both died at the scene.</p>
<p>The State’s first witness was James Murray, who said he had woken early that day to go for his first ever cycle ride in Umhlanga.</p>
<p>He said he was driving in his car heading north on the M4 when a black GTI “travelling at great speed&#8221; came up behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The road was empty. The vehicle got extremely close behind me and suddenly veered out and overtook. Another light coloured vehicle then overtook me. They appeared to be travelling together at high speed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Guilty/not guilty plea</p>
<p>Murray said he lost sight of them for a few seconds. When he rounded the bend, someone flagged him down.</p>
<p>&#8220;The GTI was stationary. It was damaged. The windscreen was smashed. I opened the door and asked if everyone was alright. The driver (who he identified as Ramnarain) just kept repeating ‘I was going straight’&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was about 30cm from him. I smelled the alcohol as I opened the door.&#8221;</p>
<p>Murray said the bikes were both mangled and the cyclists were &#8220;obviously seriously injured&#8221;.</p>
<p>While he initially said that the cyclists were both in the emergency lane, after being shown pictures of the scene by Pitman, he conceded that they were in the left hand lane.</p>
<p>Pitman also suggested that he had not spoken to Ramnarain while he was in his car and that he had already gotten out.</p>
<p>Murray conceded that he could not say whether the smell of alcohol was coming from the accused or a passenger.</p>

<p>Last year, Ramnarian’s previous attorneys told Maharaj that he would plead guilty to the charges in terms of a plea bargain agreement with Prosecutor Herman Mouton.</p>
<p>However, on the day of the proposed plea, his new attorneys indicated that he would now plead not guilty at a trial, sparking outrage from the victims&#8217; families.</p>
<p>In his statement on Monday, he sought to clarify this by saying he had never acknowledged any guilt and that reports that he had &#8220;changed his plea&#8221; were false.</p>
<p>He said all negotiations had taken place between the State and his erstwhile lawyers &#8220;and I decided that I could not plead guilty to something in respect of which I was not guilty despite the advice of my lawyers&#8221;.</p>
<p>The trial continues on Tuesday.</p>

<p>This thanks to a new high-tech armband, which will store their personal information, including contact details for parents in case of an emergency.</p>
<p>The festival will take place in Durban, Umhlanga and Ballito, from December 2 to December 9.</p>
<p>That will be few days after the end of their matric exams on November 28.</p>
<p>Howler™ is a platform that is used by event organisers to consolidate event planning, promotion, management and financial control.</p>
<p>Their armband will not only store crucial information but also act as a wallet as part of the “pay with a tap” concept giving patrons cashless access to 100 taxis and an array of restaurants and service providers.</p>
<p>The device will also act as a ticket for matriculants, who are referred to as Ragers.</p>
<p>“Cashless is not new at these festivals, but the fact that these armbands now capture parents’ personal information, which organisers can access easily if there’s a problem, is.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to give mum and dad peace of mind. If something goes wrong, they will know immediately.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started testing the concept at Rage 2016, and after a very successful run we decided to roll it out across the entire festival – giving thousands of students a safe and seamless, 100% cashless experience” said Howler chief executive Shai Evian.</p>
<p>The armbands operate through Howler’s radio-frequency identification technology, which uses electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects.</p>
<p>The tags contain electronically stored information.</p>
<p>When Ragers receive their Howler armbands, their profiles are linked with their pre-purchased Rage passports, and it is during this process that their personal identifying details are synced with their armbands.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 2005, Rage Festival has grown from 500 attendees to more than 30 000 matriculants celebrating the end of their high school years, organisers said.</p>
<p>Organisers believe that the armband will make it “the biggest, safest and most-progressive cashless event in South Africa”.</p>

No more wasting time in the kitchen or at the shops as UberEATS has finally arrived in Durban.</p>
<p>UberEATS is an online meal ordering and delivery service powered by Uber. It partners with the best local restaurants in dozens of cities around the world to get people the food they want delivered faster.</p>
<p>The service operates in Johannesburg, Cape Town, Pretoria and Stellenbosch, where it has proved popular. UberEATS, which was launched in South Africa, earlier this year, has finally added Durban to it’s list. It was launched this week at the Botanical Gardens.</p>
<p>In Durban, the app works in the CBD, Durban North, uMhlanga, Morningside and the Ballito areas, and the restaurants include: RocoMama’s, Afro’s Chicken, Bombay Blu, Pop-Up Society, Spiga D’Oro, Silverani’s, McDonalds, Kauai and KFC.</p>
<p>“Durbanites love food so we are excited to expand to the city as we know they have been waiting in anticipation. “We look forward to making life more tasty, accessible and more convenient,” said the general manager for UberEATS Middle East and Africa, Nic Robertson.</p>
<p>“The app gives diners access to whatever they like with benefits of customised orders. From sushi to doughnuts or burgers, we’ve got more than 69 cuisines customers can choose from across Durban, Gauteng and Cape Town.</p>
<p>“Restaurants can tap into the UberEATS delivery network to expand their businesses and reach a new network of customers.</p>
<p>“Delivery partners have access to even more flexible earning opportunities.”</p>
<p>But what about restaurants with existing delivery services? Speaking to managers of some of Durban’s restaurants and fast food outlets and asking if they will be joining UberEATS, a Debonairs manager said it would not be joining as it is fully covered and satisfied with the delivery system it is using.</p>
<p>Nando’s manager Jared Neil said it would also not be joining UberEATS as it saw no use of it because Nando’s already uses another popular food service, Mr Delivery.</p>
<p>UberEATS says it delivers across 1 422km2, has more than 35 000 different items to choose from, and takes an average delivery time of 33 minutes.</p>
<p>First time users around Durban can use the code “HELLODURBS” to enjoy free delivery for three orders, valid for two weeks.</p>

No more wasting time in the kitchen or at the shops as UberEATS has finally arrived in Durban.</p>
<p>UberEATS is an online meal ordering and delivery service powered by Uber. It partners with the best local restaurants in dozens of cities around the world to get people the food they want delivered faster.</p>
<p>The service operates in Johannesburg, Cape Town, Pretoria and Stellenbosch, where it has proved popular. UberEATS, which was launched in South Africa, earlier this year, has finally added Durban to it’s list. It was launched this week at the Botanical Gardens.</p>
<p>In Durban, the app works in the CBD, Durban North, uMhlanga, Morningside and the Ballito areas, and the restaurants include: RocoMama’s, Afro’s Chicken, Bombay Blu, Pop-Up Society, Spiga D’Oro, Silverani’s, McDonalds, Kauai and KFC.</p>

<p>The organisation said it extended an invitation to all presidential candidates and Ramaphosa was the first to accept. Chairperson Faisal Suliman said issues affecting the country including crime, health and unemployment would be discussed.</p>
<p>“Beyond this, we hope to look at issues affecting the broader Indian community such as the recent talk that BEE policies might be changed. We want to know how these changes will impact on us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zooming into the Muslim community, Suliman said the organisation needed clarity from ANC leadership about its policies on Palestine, Rohingya and other humanitarian issues. He said they also needed clarity on terrorism issues linked to Islamic State.</p>
<p>“We believe that for a long time a false front had been portrayed by people who were trying to create instability within the Muslim community. It is important that we engage with our leaders and to raise issues that we have.&#8221;</p>
<p>The discussion is at 4pm at Durban University of Technology’s Mansfield Hall, Gate 8, Steve Biko Campus.</p>

<p>Durbanites eat the least sugar and salt while Cape Town and Johannesburg residents are better at stocking up on fruit and vegetables.</p>
<p>This is among the findings of the Discovery Vitality ObeCity Index 2017‚ released on Wednesday‚ which presents the latest insights on weight status as measured by Body Mass Index and waist circumference and food purchasing behaviour of nearly half a million Vitality members in Johannesburg‚ Pretoria‚ Cape Town‚ Durban‚ Bloemfontein and Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Cape Town scores best with 53.5% of Capetonians having a normal weight status.</p>
<p>Johannesburg and Durban came in at second and third with 52% and 51.8%‚ respectively.</p>
<p>Port Elizabeth and Bloemfontein have the worst weight status‚ with 48.8% of residents having a healthy weight status in both cities.</p>
<p>&#8220;While there are some positive trends‚ we still have a lot to do to combat obesity‚&#8221; the index&#8217;s authors said in a statement‚ noting the increased risk of heart disease‚ type 2 diabetes‚ certain cancers and premature death.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our data shows that being obese increases healthcare costs by as much as R4‚400 per person per year.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s no surprise that we find ourselves in this situation as our eating habits have changed for the worse in recent decades. In fact‚ statistics show that South Africans now spend more money on beer than on vegetables and fruit combined. We are increasingly foregoing whole‚ fresh foods in favour of energy-dense processed foods and sugary soft drinks. This is compounded by the fact that we’re exercising less with more sedentary lifestyles.&#8221;</p>
<p>In South Africa‚ sales of ready-made meals‚ snack bars and instant noodles increased by 40% between 2005 and 2010‚ Vitality said‚ adding fast food consumption continues to grow‚ negatively impacting our weight.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a long way to go to reach a healthy weight status as a nation. South Africans in general consume insufficient portions of vegetables and fruit and too much sugar and salt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cape Town purchased the most portions of fruit and vegetables compared to other cities‚ followed by Johannesburg and Bloemfontein. Port Elizabeth and Durban purchased the least portions of fruit and vegetables.</p>
<p>Durban purchased 34% less fruit and vegetables compared to Cape Town‚ the winning city.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see a positive relationship between weight status and fruit and vegetable purchasing‚&#8221; said Discovery.</p>
<p>South Africans overall are eating only three servings of fruit and veg (230g) a day instead of the recommended five servings (400g)‚ the index stated.</p>
<p>Durbanites purchased the least amount of salt compared to other cities‚ with second and third place being held by residents in Port Elizabeth and Pretoria‚ respectively. Johannesburg and Cape Town purchased the most amount of salt. The data shows Durban residents purchased just over a quarter less salt‚ than Johannesburg‚ the city with the highest amount of salt purchased.</p>

<p>Commenting on the index‚ Discovery said its data shows that members who purchase healthy foods have a 10% lower BMI compared to those who purchase unhealthy foods. It states the same purchasing behaviour is associated with up to R2‚500 lower health costs per year.</p>
<p>Its advice is simple &#8211; cook at home at least five times a week.</p>
<p>&#8220;Studies show that homemade meals typically contain more vegetables and less fat than any other meal. People who cook at home are almost certain to consume fewer kilojoules‚ more variety‚ adequate nutrients and fewer processed foods.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition: &#8220;Home-cooked meals allow for appropriate portion sizes‚ while restaurant portions are known to be unnecessarily large. This contributes to the overeating culture and the global obesity issue&#8221;.</p>

It is this single factor instilled in individuals since childhood that has contributed to stereotyping and prejudice across societies and cultures. Stories have instigated wars and political mudslinging, racial segregation and gender discrimination, generational and cross-country hostility, and bitterness between low and high-income communities.
Even Africa is perceived in a certain way because of the stories being told about it. The role of traditional media and social media are key players in the way the world views Africa, and possibly contributes to putting the brakes on the continent’s development.
How do the stories we disseminate shape how the rest of the world views Africa? How does it affect foreign investment? How does it influence markets and economic output? These are some of the questions we should be asking, along with how to change our one-sided approach.
Even research indicates that attitudes and views have been shaped in a specific manner.</p>
<p>Influence
The US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), for example, explored the neurobiology of listening to stories and how attitudes and behaviours can change. It found that storytelling changes views about people for the better or worse and significantly influences societies.</p>
<p>“Narrative exerts a powerful influence on human thoughts and behaviour. They consolidate memory, shape emotions, cue heuristics and biases in judgment, influence in-group/out-group distinctions, and may affect the fundamental content of personal identity,” it states.
Meanwhile Octavia Utley’s curriculum at the Yale-New Haven Teacher’s Institute explored this tradition in Africa. She found that storytelling throughout history made it possible for African cultures to pass on knowledge, history and experiences from one generation to the next, manifesting itself in different ways and serving many purposes.</p>
<p>“It was used to interpret the universe, resolve natural and physical phenomena, teach morals, maintain culture values, pass on methods of survival and praise God,” said Utley in her paper titled, Keeping the tradition of African storytelling alive.</p>
<p>This data tells us that a story is not just a story. Narratives have shaped societies, and the world has been significantly affected by the stories we have told about each other. Collectively we have all in some way contributed to bias stories without due consideration of its consequences.</p>
<p>So how do we change our views from what was instilled in us as children, and how do we ensure the next generation do not stereotype others?</p>
<p>Perceptions
There are many layers to unravel and now is the time to review our attitudes and perceptions of others. We need to challenge our internal and exported narrative because this is where behavior change begins. Parents, in particular, need to be mindful about the type of stories they tell their children, and be aware of books they are reading.</p>
<p>Now is the time for the people of Africa to tell a new story. Tell the world about our unique heritage, majestic views, vibrant fashion and tasty foods. Tell them about our talented youth, our humanitarians, our innovations, and our uniquely African projects.

We will ensure that we empower them through our new stories and help them grow into good people without prejudice.</p>

<p>This interchange is designed to provide continuous access to the Verulam, Phoenix, Mount Edgecombe, uMhlanga Ridge Town Centre and the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast.</p>
<p>Corné Roux, the Eastern Region project manager for SANRAL said that the biggest challenge was accommodating the traffic during construction.</p>
<p>“The interchange sits on a major national road, the N2, and the M41 feeds major residential, industrial and commercial areas such as Phoenix, Mt Edgecombe and uMhlanga carrying high volumes of traffic which had to be kept moving during the interchange’s construction,&#8221; said Roux.</p>
<p>He added that another challenge was the ground conditions that needed the installation of extensive piling to support the interchange structures.</p>
<p>Despite the lengthy construction period and disruptions on this busy stretch of road, motorists are now feeling the benefits of the interchange which has dramatically improved traffic flow through the area.</p>
<p>The new roads have state-of-the-art lighting making the intersection safer and more visible at night while the pedestrian bridge also makes it safer and more convenient for people to cross the N2.</p>
<p>According to Roux, the Mount Edgecombe Interchange is now a landmark structure and an important artery of the greater eThekwini metropolitan highway system for easing traffic, relieving congestion and is also a significant business enabler.</p>
<p>Managing Director of Tongaat Hulett Developments Michael Deighton said, “Not only has the new interchange improved driving conditions in this previously congested area but it will also unlock significant development opportunities planned for the KwaZulu-Natal north coast&#8221;.</p>

<p>The draft, aimed at setting ownership and transformation targets for the sector, was opposed by the industry even though it acknowledged that the current document was in many respects an improvement on the previous one proposed by Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe’s predecessor Mosebenzi Zwane.</p>
<p>The draft charter had a requirement of 10% ‘free carry’ interest for mining communities and employees on new mining rights as part of the proposed 30% black equity ownership target.</p>
<p>The contents of the bill will have an effect on trade union Solidarity’s current strike against white employees being excluded from Sasol’s Khanyisa share scheme.</p>

<p>“The department will be tabling this biofuel framework to cabinet for its consideration and approval before end of March 2019,” said Jeff Radebe in a speech prepared for an energy conference in Cape Town.</p>
<p>The framework deals with, among other things, the mandatory purchase of biofuels by licensed manufacturers and feedstock plans that do not compromise food security, said Radebe.

According to account director, Leandra Moodley, the theme for the 10th annual BRICS Summit was ‘BRICS in Africa: Collaboration for Inclusive Growth and Shared Prosperity in the 4th Industrial Revolution&#8217; and aimed to reflect the priorities of the BRICS members.
&#8220;The agency was briefed to assist Brand South Africa and the Department of Trade and Industry with the BRICS Business Forum, one of several events making up the BRICS Leaders’ Summit,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Its responsibility was the creative curatorship and delivery of an event for 1 200 delegates that included a panel discussion session in the afternoon and a cocktail party in the evening. Attended by President Cyril Ramaphosa and Chinese President Xi Jinping, it was critical that the creative design and execution projected for South Africa as a highly industrialised country embracing the Fourth Industrial Revolution,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a challenging task, addressed within a very tight time frame,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;However, it was highly successful, and we are thrilled to have been able to contribute so positively to South Africa’s role and image within the BRICS community.&#8221;</p>

<p>Put another way, 32.4% of the 10.3 million people in that age group were “not in employment, education or training in the first quarter of 2018”. That’s 3.3 million young people sitting at home, idle.</p>
<p>Unemployment is a structural issue which has seen little improvement in recent years and is one of the four critical dimensions impeding the country’s ability to improve socio-economic well-being. The other three being education, income inequality and health care.</p>
<p>Poor education results in a lack of skills, which contributes to high unemployment. High unemployment fosters income inequality and slow economic growth, which in turn limit access to, and funding for, education; access to and funding for health care are similarly imperilled.</p>
<p>Unemployment among the youth is an even more complicated and layered challenge.</p>
<p>South Africa’s youth presents the best opportunity for addressing ingrained poverty and socio-economic challenges in the country.</p>
<p>An employed, and economically active youth, represents the best opportunity for long-term sustained economic growth.</p>
<p>While the reality is that employment opportunities remain limited, there are ways that young people can make themselves more employable or create employment opportunities.</p>
<p>* Entrepreneurship as a way to create jobs:</p>
<p>Most young people don’t think of entrepreneurship as a career but starting, and successfully managing, your own business will not only ensure you of an income; it could lead to job creation for other people in your community.</p>
<p>According to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitors 2017/2018 report, total early-stage entrepreneurial activity in South Africa is at 11%, 4.1% points higher than 2016’s 6.9%. This is the highest activity level of people taking steps to start a new business since 2013.</p>
<p>While this is positive, South Africa’s Small Medium and Micro Enterprises space remains constrained by poor access to credit, bureaucratic red tape, and policies that discourage entrepreneurship. Governments and the private sector need to examine ways to ensure that these barriers to entry are dismantled, especially when it comes to empowering young people.</p>
<p>For the youth, identifying an opportunity to provide a service or product in their community is just the first step. Growing and nurturing a business takes patience and skill.</p>
<p>* Fighting unemployment and creating new skills through vocational training:</p>
<p>There is an obvious need for South Africa to strengthen its vocational training. This country needs more artisans and people in technical jobs. Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) has the potential to both close skills gaps and reduce unemployment.</p>
<p>According to a report from global skills development company City and Guilds Group, a survey of South African chief executives found that 36% were extremely concerned about the availability of key skills, compared to a global average of 17%.</p>

<p>* Fighting unemployment and creating new skills through vocational training:</p>
<p>There is an obvious need for South Africa to strengthen its vocational training. This country needs more artisans and people in technical jobs. Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) has the potential to both close skills gaps and reduce unemployment.</p>
<p>According to a report from global skills development company City and Guilds Group, a survey of South African chief executives found that 36% were extremely concerned about the availability of key skills, compared to a global average of 17%.</p>
<p>Minister of Higher Education and Training Naledi Pandor recently announced that TVET colleges were at the forefront of providing education and training options for our youth and that the bursary allocation for TVET colleges has increased from R2.437billion in 2017 to R5.164bn in 2018.</p>
<p>Pandor also announced that for 2018/19 an additional R2.5bn will be made available for student fees, including travel and accommodation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is a lingering perception among the youth that TVET colleges are inferior to traditional tertiary institutions. Last year the government admitted that TVET institutions had been neglected, but this positive step by the minister hopefully signals a shift in attitude.</p>
<p>For many young people in South Africa studying towards a trade could be a good way to ensure a stable future.</p>
<p>* Digital skills to meet future demand:</p>
<p>As the Fourth Industrial Revolution rolls on, the demand for digital skills among the youth grows exponentially.</p>
<p>According to a study by jobs portal Adzuna, technology positions make up seven of the top 10 rarest job skills in South Africa.</p>
<p>Technology is changing every aspect of business. A study by data analytics firm IDC, “State of Digital Transformation in South Africa”, showed that skills remain a challenge for businesses and companies which do not have the required skills in-house, and have to develop them.</p>
<p>Access to skills training is, of course, a challenge but many private companies are reaching out and partnering with government to address this. In March, President Cyril Ramaphosa launched the YES initiative. This takes the form of a partnership between the government business labour and civil society and aims to create 500000 jobs a year for youth.</p>
<p>Technology is pervasive, and apart from it being a growing employment opportunity for youth, it is also an important skill which employers will demand from all their employees in the future.</p>
<p>Young people who want to be employable cannot ignore the importance of digital literacy as part of their training and education.</p>
<p>Solving South Africa’s youth unemployment will take a long-term concerted effort underpinned by strong economic growth.</p>
<p>It falls on the youth, however to take proactive steps to ensure they can play a role in meeting the challenge.</p>
<p>Approaching employment from an innovative or disruptive stand point is one way of doing this.</p>
<p>The other is arming themselves with the skills and knowledge which will make them employable not just tomorrow but for decades to come.</p>

<p>But eyes should also be on corporate South Africa to see how it will respond to these latest numbers.</p>
<p>One initiative that has quickly gained traction is the Mandela Centenary Campaign, whose vision is to raise R100 million for job creation and literacy in the year of what would have been Nelson Mandela’s 100th birthday.</p>
<p>Long-term effects</p>
<p>It’s the brainchild of South African social enterprise, the Relate Trust, and kicked off at the end of March 2018. The project has two main aims: to create earning opportunities for unskilled people (who make the special centenary bracelets) and to fund the Mandela Library project (with the proceeds from the sale of these bracelets).</p>
<p>In just four months, the initiative has secured partnerships with several big businesses who looked beyond 67 minutes on Mandela Day in favour of being part of a vision that will have a long-term effect on thousands of South Africans.</p>
<p>The Relate Trust raises funds for other NGOs, while empowering some of South Africa’s poorest communities. Their unique business model is a proven success as it has raised more than R50 million for over 120 charities globally, while creating thousands of jobs in the process.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Relate CEO, Neil Robinson, says that in terms of stepping up job creation efforts, the centenary campaign is crucial: “The number of people between the ages of 15 and 34 not in education, training or employment increased to 39.3%, or four out of ten, in the second quarter of this year. This is a crisis that needs to be addressed now. We offer a simple and tangible solution for individuals and companies to make a real difference by coming on board, as other major brands have done.”</p>
<p>The companies who have already partnered with the Relate Trust come from a number of sectors and include Pick n Pay, Protea Hotels by Marriott, Woolworths, South32 (formerly BHP Billiton), and Comair, among others.</p>
<p>&#8216;A national priority&#8217;</p>
<p>South32 Chief Operating Officer, Mike Fraser, says that the Mandela Centenary campaign supports the company’s commitment to making a difference in communities. The mining group has gifted thousands of bracelets to their staff across the country.</p>
<p>“Every year for Mandela Day, our people come together to help alleviate poverty by taking time out to serve and assist various charitable organisations in our communities. This year, we’re proud to support this cause which makes a difference and improves lives now and for generations to come, by giving our employees a special bracelet that honours Nelson Mandela’s centenary and legacy,” Fraser said.</p>

It is why Comair is supporting the year-long Mandela Centenary campaign, providing thousands of bracelets for its employees.”</p>
<p>For Woolworths, the partnership with Relate is a continuation of a long-standing relationship based on mutual principles of sustainability.   The campaign is at the core of Relate’s endeavour to make every day of Madiba’s hundredth year a Mandela Day.</p>
<p>One library impacts 15 000 children</p>
<p>The beneficiary that the bracelets support – the Mandela Library Project – installs and implements the running of container libraries in under-resourced schools across South Africa.</p>
<p>The direct link between education and employment is also well-documented. Alice Albright, CEO of Global Partnership for Education puts it simply: “Chronic youth unemployment puts a brake on national economies, and the lack of a literate and skilled young workforce limits businesses’ ability to generate higher growth, better profits and more jobs”.</p>
<p>Through this one initiative, thousands of jobs can be created while literacy resources will impact tens of thousands of children directly.</p>
<p>Businesses who would like to get involved with the campaign should contact Relate at bracelets@relate.org.za.</p>
<p>About The Relate Trust:</p>
<p>The Relate Trust is a proudly 100% not-for-profit social enterprise which predominantly sells handmade beaded bracelets to raise money for charities globally, while creating jobs for people in low-income communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the last three years alone, Relate has raised more than R26 million for causes in health, education, conservation, social upliftment, and children’s and women’s empowerment, while raising more than R50 million since it became a trust in 2010.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<img width="210" height="158" src="http://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/rama-210x158.jpg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="" style="float: left; margin-right: 5px;" /><p>Ramaphosa made the remarks during his address to a breakfast meeting with SA business leaders on Sunday in the Chinese capital city of Beijing‚ during a state visit hosted by Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>Xi was in SA in June on a similar visit ahead of the recent Brazil‚ Russia‚ India‚ China and SA (Brics) summit.</p>
<p>Ramaphosa said ahead of the two-day Forum on China-Africa Co-operation summit that the government needed to provide not just &#8220;policy certainty but policy consistency&#8221; to investors to attract much-needed foreign direct investment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re recalibrating in many ways‚ we’re sharpening our messages to enhance investment to come our way‚&#8221; said Ramaphosa.</p>
<p>&#8216;Policy certainty&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the key issues that faced us was the issue of policy certainty which many possible investors wanted clarity on.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re working through that‚ we’re working through all the issues that have been raised with us‚ to make sure that we do have not only policy certainty but policy consistency. This is something that has slipped through our fingers in the past few years where we have lost our shine‚ but we’re regaining that shine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dozens of African leaders are in Beijing for the summit at which Xi is expected to stress growth in Sino-African trade partnerships.</p>
<p>The South African economy was battered as the previous Zuma-lead administration dithered on key policy issues affecting crucial sectors such as mining and energy while state-owned companies were plagued by allegations of corruption and financial mismanagement.</p>
<p>SA has also grabbed international attention with its parliamentary process to amend section 25 of the constitution to allow for expropriation of land without compensation in a bid to change patterns of land ownership.</p>
<p>Ramaphosa said he was confident that we would &#8220;surprise the world&#8221; in resolving the emotive issue of land as South Africans were &#8220;becoming more rational&#8221; in discussing mechanisms to resolve land reform and redistribution.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no doubt that South Africans will step up to the plate to resolve it‚ like we resolved the apartheid problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;The apartheid problem was once thought to be the most intractable problem in the whole world and people thought that SA would get engaged in a civil war that would tear the whole nation apart‚&#8221; said Ramaphosa.</p>

<p>Xi was in SA in June on a similar visit ahead of the recent Brazil‚ Russia‚ India‚ China and SA (Brics) summit.</p>
<p>Ramaphosa said ahead of the two-day Forum on China-Africa Co-operation summit that the government needed to provide not just &#8220;policy certainty but policy consistency&#8221; to investors to attract much-needed foreign direct investment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re recalibrating in many ways‚ we’re sharpening our messages to enhance investment to come our way‚&#8221; said Ramaphosa.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Policy certainty&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;One of the key issues that faced us was the issue of policy certainty which many possible investors wanted clarity on.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re working through that‚ we’re working through all the issues that have been raised with us‚ to make sure that we do have not only policy certainty but policy consistency. This is something that has slipped through our fingers in the past few years where we have lost our shine‚ but we’re regaining that shine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dozens of African leaders are in Beijing for the summit at which Xi is expected to stress growth in Sino-African trade partnerships.</p>
<p>The South African economy was battered as the previous Zuma-lead administration dithered on key policy issues affecting crucial sectors such as mining and energy while state-owned companies were plagued by allegations of corruption and financial mismanagement.</p>
<p>SA has also grabbed international attention with its parliamentary process to amend section 25 of the constitution to allow for expropriation of land without compensation in a bid to change patterns of land ownership.</p>
<p>Ramaphosa said he was confident that we would &#8220;surprise the world&#8221; in resolving the emotive issue of land as South Africans were &#8220;becoming more rational&#8221; in discussing mechanisms to resolve land reform and redistribution.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no doubt that South Africans will step up to the plate to resolve it‚ like we resolved the apartheid problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;The apartheid problem was once thought to be the most intractable problem in the whole world and people thought that SA would get engaged in a civil war that would tear the whole nation apart‚&#8221; said Ramaphosa.</p>
<p>Ramaphosa said Xi had been supportive on the issue of land reform in their previous discussions and the two leaders were due to hold further bilateral talks later on Sunday.</p>
<p>Beijing and Pretoria were also due sign new trade deals that would see more Chinese companies investing in SA.</p>

<p>The rand was nearly 2.5% stronger in morning trade against the dollar on Tuesday, after sliding as much as 9.4% on Monday – the most since October 2008.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported some analysts saying that there are few fundamental reasons for assets across emerging markets to fall because of the lira. Turkey’s problems stem from president Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s standoff with the US administration.</p>
<p>With average inflation rates at record lows and current-account balances improving, the developing world is diverging from Turkey. Still, the sell-off has helped make valuations attractive, Bloomberg said. An index of emerging-market stocks is near the cheapest since early 2016, before a two-year rally started.</p>
<p>“After a large sell-off triggered by the rout in Turkey, some investors may have bought emerging currencies on dips,” said Toru Nishihama, Tokyo-based emerging-market economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc.</p>
<p>“The global economy is still expanding and that’s providing underlying support for the emerging markets. But Turkey’s problems from its spat with the US, issues of central bank independence and inflationary pressures are not resolved, which means downward pressure on Turkish assets will continue for a while.”</p>
<p>“Concerns will linger over who could be the next hit. Would that be South Africa because of its weak fundamentals or Russia with deteriorating relations with the US or Mexico where the peso has been purchased on expectations surrounding the new president but no concrete outcome has been delivered?” Nishihama said.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The rand’s performance</p>
<p>According to analysis by Rand Merchant Bank, markets are still digesting their exposure to the Turkish crisis as the lira steadied in Asian trade.</p>
<p>“Turkey’s reliance on foreign funding, as evidenced by its wide current account deficit and its corporates’ exposure to foreign currency debt, renders it vulnerable to higher global yields and a stronger dollar,” the group said.</p>
<p>Contagion from the Turkey crisis prompted intervention from central banks in several countries including Indonesia and Argentina.</p>
<p>While South Africa is also heavily reliant on foreign inflows, the South African Reserve Bank confirmed that intervention would not be necessary in the local market.</p>
<p>“We expect the rand will continue to pull back, and have not changed our minds that the year-end range is between R13 and R14,” RMB said.</p>
<p>RMB said that the slipping rand implies that it has pushed weaker than its long-term PPP (purchasing power parity) fair value.</p>
<p>“Interestingly, rand valuation on the PPP scale implies the currency is close to the value of other high risk currencies measured on the same basis,” RMB said.</p>
<p>The rand outperformance at the start of the year has been worked away, the financial services firm said.</p>
<p>Hugo Pienaar, senior economist at the Bureau for Economic Research, said on Twitter that while there is “lots to worry about in SA”, the rand crash was driven by Turkey woes and strong US dollar, and was likely an over-reaction by the market.</p>

<p>Reserve Bank’s view</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported that the South African Reserve Bank won’t intervene to prop up the rand unless the orderly functioning of markets is threatened, citing Deputy Governor Daniel Mminele.</p>
<p>While South Africa’s central bank is monitoring the currency, it prefers that market forces determine the exchange rate, Mminele told Bloomberg.</p>
<p>“Where we find ourselves in a situation where there could be market dislocation, where there could be a threat to the orderly functioning of our markets, we certainly would consider becoming involved there, but our judgment is what we have seen does not get us to a situation where we need to consider that at the moment,” he said.</p>
<p>“We would not become involved with a view of influencing the exchange rate in a particular direction or wishing to stem the depreciating pressure in a very targeted way.”</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank targets inflation in a band of 3% to 6%. It held the key interest rate last month, citing the rand as a risk to the price outlook. The Monetary Policy Committee will only respond to currency weakness if it feeds through to the wider economy, Mminele said.</p>
<p>Pass-through from currency weakness into South African consumer prices has weakened in recent years, a study by economists from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund has shown, making it even less likely that the central bank will raise interest rates any time soon.</p>
<p>The consumer-inflation rate has been inside the target range for more than a year, and is forecast to remain there through 2020.</p>
<p>“We would not overreact to initial price pressures and would be guided by our collective judgment and assessment of how we see knock-on effects and second-round effects of any price pressures that then could contribute to inflation,” he said.</p>
<p>The local unit traded at the following levels against the major currencies:</p>
<p>Dollar/Rand: R14.08  (-2.42%)</p>
<p>Pound/Rand : R18.08  (-1.66%)</p>
<p>Euro/Rand: R16.15  (-1.63%)</p>

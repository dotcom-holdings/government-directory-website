<p>Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry Bulelani Magwanishe on Wednesday said the Taking the dti to the People Campaign aims to empower communities with information to take advantage of opportunities offered by government.</p>
<p>“It also seeks to build community capacity with the aim of addressing current economic issues in order to accelerate job creation and sustainable economic development in the country. The outreach also creates awareness about products and services offered by the dti and its agencies,” said Deputy Minister Magwanishe.</p>
<p>Government interaction with the community will take place at the Multi-Purpose Centre in Joza Township, Grahamstown.</p>
<p>Aspiring entrepreneurs and SMMEs will get an opportunity to engage with officials from the National Consumer Commission (NCC), National Credit Regulator (NCR) and Companies and Intellectual Property Commission.</p>
<p>The outreach, which forms part of Public Service Month, enhances government&#8217;s commitment to work together with communities to encourage sharing and create structures which give genuine participation and involvement, to better the lives of all South Africans.</p>

<p>“These are the good women and men of this community who make sure that children with HIV feel they belong and have a place under the warm African sun,” the Deputy President said on Sunday.</p>
<p>He was speaking at the official opening of the Vuyo Mbuli Empilisweni HIV/AIDS and Orphans Centre in Ndevana in the Eastern Cape.</p>
<p>The centre is a community initiative which started operations in 1999 with the help of the late SABC TV presenter Vuyo Mbuli and was officially registered as a non-profit organisation in 2002.</p>
<p>The centre – whose main focus is on HIV and Aids orphans – also works with caregivers of people who are on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and Tuberculosis (TB) treatment. The facility has been commissioned by the Department of Health to trace treatment defaulters in the area.</p>
<p>The Deputy President paid tribute to the caregivers who visit children in homes where there are no mothers and fathers.</p>
<p>“They are there to close the eyes of the deceased and comfort the living. They refuse to let the soul of our nation to be corrupted by the cardinal sin of neglecting hungry and homeless children.</p>
<p>“They feed, bathe, and clothe the sick and the weak. It is them who show our vulnerable children the door of the classroom,” he said.</p>
<p>Deputy President Ramaphosa said the leadership of the centre had crafted grand plans to stimulate economic activity and create jobs.</p>
<p>“They have internalised our National Development Plan and they have identified the areas that can yield positive results. We have been touched and moved by the vision you have crafted of achieving a community that is not haunted by poverty and shackled by injustice.”</p>
<p>Deputy Minister of Telecommunications and Postal Services Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams said the care centre will be supported with Information and Communications Technology (ICT) services.</p>
<p>This, said the Deputy President, is a significant step in bringing this much needed service to the community.</p>
<p>He added that the computer centre at the clinic will be developed in partnership with the State Information Technology Agency (SITA), MTN and the Universal Service and Access Agency of South Africa (USAASA).</p>
<p>He called for the initiative to be replicated in other areas to close the information technology gap and to prepare children for the knowledge economy and the fourth industrial revolution.</p>
<p>“We also want to acknowledge and call upon past, present and future potential partners to continue strengthening the work of this remarkable care centre.”</p>
<p>The Deputy President said it was pleasing for government to see companies stepping up to help the centre. This as Aspen Pharmacare has committed to provide the centre with solar water heaters.</p>
<p>In addition, government also applauded the National Lotteries Commission for being an excellent corporate citizen.</p>
<p>“Through their generous contribution, today we have the awe-inspiring Empilisweni building. This is the type of tangible outcomes that will assist the Empilisweni Centre and community to be better equipped to manage its operations,” he said.</p>

<p>“It is a facility that will allow us to expand government’s e-health strategy by providing advanced clinical support to rural areas. These investments in infrastructure, technology and innovation will contribute significantly to improve the health outcomes for the people of Mdantsane and the region,” said the Deputy President on Sunday.</p>
<p>Speaking at the unveiling of the new wing of the hospital in Mdantsane, East London, Deputy President Ramaphosa said investments in infrastructure to the tune of R1 billion will support local economic development in the townships.</p>
<p>“They will also support local government efforts to improve community infrastructure. As we revitalise public health infrastructure, we are also expanding opportunities for local communities to improve their lives through job creation and local enterprise development.”</p>
<p>Deputy President Ramaphosa said the 526-bed hospital is a national asset that must be treasured and celebrated. The hospital is supported by an integrated system that will optimise efficiencies in the delivery of quality healthcare. The integrated system, which uses technological innovation, will cut down patient waiting times, improve diagnosis and improve health outcomes.</p>
<p>The hospital will provide support to districts and maternity units through telemedicine and outreach programmes by specialist teams.</p>
<p>“This state-of-the-art health facility is a victory in our people’s cause to build a united, equal, non-racial, non-sexist and prosperous society. The unveiling of the new wing of Cecilia Makiwane Hospital takes place during Heritage Month.”</p>
<p>He paid tribute to nursing pioneer Cecilia Makiwane, after whom the hospital is named. Makiwane was South Africa’s first professional black nurse.</p>
<p>Government 15 years ago introduced the Cecilia Makiwane Nurse’s Recognition Award for distinguished health care professionals in her honour. As both teacher and nurse, Makiwane chose vocations where she would make her greatest contributions to the betterment of her people’s lives.</p>
<p>Deputy President Ramaphosa said struggle stalwart Steve Biko, who built the Zanempilo Community Health Centre for the rural community of Zinyoka outside King William’s Town, would be pleased that all is being done to ensure health care for everyone.</p>
<p>Implementation of the NHI</p>
<p>“Come rain or shine, South Africa will have the inclusive National Health Insurance to ensure quality, safety, and efficient health provision for all our citizens,” said the Deputy President.</p>
<p>Government is implementing the NHI to ensure health equity by reorganising the public and private health system. Through the NHI, funds will be pooled to provide access to quality health services for all South Africans based on their health needs, irrespective of their socio-economic status.</p>
<p>Already, South Africa spends far above the recommended 5% by the World Health Organisation (WHO) of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on health, while the public health system also caters for more than 80% of the population.</p>

<p>On Wednesday afternoon, Weather SA forecaster Wisani Maluleke said a cold front was expected to hit the Western Cape this weekend. He said it would be moving across the Eastern Cape and it looked like it would reach KwaZulu-Natal early next week.</p>
<p>“We should start feeling it in KZN on Monday,” he said, “Snow is expected to fall in some parts of the province, including over the Southern Drakensberg.” Malukele said the forecast for Thursday looked cold and wet. And that a drop in the mercury, along with rain and strong winds, could be expected.</p>
<p>But he said flash flooding was not on the cards. Regardless, Malukele urged people to take extra cautionary measures during cold spells.</p>
<p>“And when we have snow, we have road closures because they become slippery. So those who do plan on travelling must be careful, because they risk getting stuck on the roads,” he said.</p>
<p>The water-stressed Western Cape looks set to get some relief this weekend, as about 20mm of rain is expected to fall in the province.</p>

<p>On Wednesday afternoon, Weather SA forecaster Wisani Maluleke said a cold front was expected to hit the Western Cape this weekend. He said it would be moving across the Eastern Cape and it looked like it would reach KwaZulu-Natal early next week.</p>
<p>“We should start feeling it in KZN on Monday,” he said, “Snow is expected to fall in some parts of the province, including over the Southern Drakensberg.” Malukele said the forecast for Thursday looked cold and wet. And that a drop in the mercury, along with rain and strong winds, could be expected.</p>
<p>But he said flash flooding was not on the cards. Regardless, Malukele urged people to take extra cautionary measures during cold spells.</p>
<p>“And when we have snow, we have road closures because they become slippery. So those who do plan on travelling must be careful, because they risk getting stuck on the roads,” he said.</p>
<p>The water-stressed Western Cape looks set to get some relief this weekend, as about 20mm of rain is expected to fall in the province.</p>

<p>&#8220;We believe that this new police station will make a significant contribution to our fight to reduce crime in this community and defeat the scourge, particularly of gangsterism, in the form of &#8216;Amavondo&#8217;, about which I have received a number of complaints,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Zuma then proceeded to the community engagement part of his visit where members of the community expressed their grievances and also provided suggestions.</p>
<p>They said government needed to address the root causes of crime and gangsterism in the area, which were unemployment and the delivery of services. They especially appealed for help to promote investments in factories and industry in the area and also asked for the improvement of the R61 road.</p>
<p>Zuma concluded the programme by undertaking to ensure that all the levels of government he brought to Lusikisiki worked speedily together to address all the challenges of the community.</p>

<p>CCBSA is introducing them to the possibilities of entrepreneurship through a concept dubbed Bizniz in a Box. This initiative gives young people between the ages of 24 and 35 and living in townships the opportunity, skills and funding to set up and run their own successful container shops.
From December last year to February this year, total revenue for the first six shops increased from just over R50 000 a month to more than R200 000, demonstrating the great potential of the programme.</p>
<p>Talented young people are selected, trained in marketing, sales, stock management and finance and given access to funding to start their container business – literally a business in a box.</p>
<p>“Aspiring entrepreneurs in SA face a number of challenges including a lack of funding and skills, fierce competition from bigger companies and regulatory challenges. These common hurdles have resulted in high failure rates for small businesses,” says Tsholofelo Mqhayi, head of enterprise and community development at CCBSA.</p>
<p>“Through the Bizniz in a Box process, we’re helping young people set up and manage thriving businesses in their communities.”</p>
<p>The programme grooms young entrepreneurs to run their own businesses through on-the-job training. This means they are assessed on their actual performance in a live environment, rather than in a classroom set-up only. It also gives candidates a taste of what it’s like to operate a micro business independently.</p>
<p>Once they’ve completed repayment of a portion of the capital cost of the store and met the performance criteria, the store is officially handed over to them and their new life as a fully independent entrepreneur begins.</p>
<p>They are also encouraged to start thinking about other opportunities outside their shop, such as opening up a franchised business.</p>

<p>Maryam Fish, 30, of Lansdowne, led an all-female team of researchers at the University of Cape Town, along with Gasnat Shaboodien and Sarah Krause, who made the discovery with researchers from Italy</p>
<p>Fifty years after South Africa performed the world&#8217;s first successful heart transplant, a woman from the Cape Flats has made another landmark medical discovery that could prevent hundreds of cardiac-related deaths every year.</p>
<p>The discovery of a gene that is a major cause of sudden death among under-35s is likely to put South Africa on the map in the world of genetics, showing that the country “is on par with international researchers”.</p>
<p>Maryam Fish, 30, of Lansdowne, led an all-female team of researchers at the University of Cape Town, along with Gasnat Shaboodien and Sarah Krause, who made the discovery with researchers from Italy.</p>
<p>The gene, called CDH2, is found in everyone, but a mutation causes a genetic disorder known as arrythmogenic right ventricle cardiomyopathy (ARVC), which increases the risk of heart disease and cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>Sudden cardiac death is estimated to hit more than five young people in South Africa daily, according to the Medical Research Council.</p>
<p>In under-35s an inherited form of disease of the heart muscle plays a prominent role in fatalities as a result of cardiac arrest.
“We sequenced all the genes in the human genome in two cousins who were affected,” said Fish, explaining that the cousins were identified after a 22-year-old relative died suddenly.</p>
<p>“We then looked for common variants and had a list of 13000, which we narrowed down through a series of filtering criteria until we got the CDH2 variant, which was the most likely causal variant in this family.”</p>
<p>The team then screened the gene in a number of unrelated individuals who also had ARVC.</p>
<p>This added “more evidence to our case that the CDH2 gene was the causal gene for ARVC”.</p>
<p>The soft-spoken PhD graduate comes from a family of good genes. Her father and brother are engineers, and her mother is a mathematician.</p>
<p>Fish said she felt “relieved that I managed to solve the problem after so long”, and didn&#8217;t agree with the assessment of her family&#8217;s gifted intelligence, shyly remarking that they were “just OK”.</p>
<p>Announcing the discovery yesterday, UCT dean of health Bongani Mayosi likened its importance to the first heart transplant, performed by Dr Christiaan Barnard at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town in 1967.</p>
<p>Mayosi began hunting for the gene himself as a young scientist in 1996. “Half of [people] will meet their Maker through sudden death,” he said. “This will help us understand a common problem by taking it forward to develop drugs that target this particular gene.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve taken God&#8217;s own experiment of an inherited condition to understand the causes of sudden death.”</p>
<p>Key to making the discovery was a new technique, whole
exome sequencing, which analyses every gene in a human&#8217;s DNA.

<p>Shaboodien said the discovery would help put South Africa on the map in genetics and showed “that we are capable of being on par with international researchers”.</p>
<p>The clinical importance of the discovery meant early detection of unsuspecting people with ARVC was now possible.</p>
<p>But Krause said testing for ARVC would not be easily<br />
accessible for most people, and the UCT research centre where they worked was one of the few places in South Africa where genetic screening was done.</p>
<p>“I think it&#8217;s important to understand there isn&#8217;t available [public] diagnostic screening in South Africa. In [the private sector] you can get blood sent overseas to be screened,” she said.</p>

<p>The party called Mahlangu a &#8220;killer&#8221; for being driving force to move patients from Life Esidimeni homes to unregistered NGOs. The NGOs were found to have been unsafe‚ crowded‚ without sufficient heating and without skilled staff. At least 94 people died from hunger‚ dehydration and diseases unrelated to mental health.</p>
<p>Mahlangu&#8217;s decision was described as &#8220;reckless&#8221; by health ombudsman Professor Malegapuru Makgoba.</p>
<p>Mahlangu&#8217;s resignation was announced on Wednesday by the Gauteng Premier.</p>
<p>The EFF says it will lay charges against anyone else implicated in the killing of the patients.</p>
<p>The ANC Youth League has also indicated it wishes to lay charges of murder against the former health MEC.</p>
<p>Jack Bloom of the Democratic Alliance said: &#8220;It took 141 days for Mahlangu to resign following the first disclosure of deaths in reply to my question in the Gauteng Legislature on 13 September last year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bloom continued: &#8220;Premier (David) Makhura has failed badly in this matter and needs to keep his promises to ensure that action is taken against all those implicated‚ including criminal charges.&#8221;</p>
<p>The DA&#8217;s health spokesman said Mahlangu&#8217;s replacement‚ Dr Gwen Ramokgopa‚ was a poor MEC when she was in charge.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not impressed with the return of Dr Gwen Ramokgopa as MEC of the Gauteng Health Department‚&#8221; said Bloom. &#8220;She was mediocre in this position previously and does not have the drive to fix this deeply dysfunctional department.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not impressed with the return of Dr Gwen Ramokgopa as MEC of the Gauteng Health Department‚&#8221; said Bloom. &#8220;She was mediocre in this position previously and does not have the drive to fix this deeply dysfunctional department.&#8221;</p>

<p>Speaking at the launch on Monday in Queenstown, Eastern Cape, Minister Davies said the industrial park has created jobs for 71 locals.</p>
<p>“During the first phase of the revitalisation programme of Komani, seven Small Micro Medium Enterprises were appointed as sub-contractors at the value of R5.3 million [and] 71 local labourers were employed and 63% of these were youth,” said Minister Davies.</p>
<p>The launch marked the completion of the first phase of the project which covers security upgrading of the park. The Department of Trade and Industry has so far invested R22.5 million in the revitalisation of the park.</p>
<p>This was in response to a call by President Jacob Zuma to work towards full scale industrialisation and inclusive growth.</p>
<p>At the launch, which was in collaboration with the provincial and local government of the Chris Hani District Municipality, as well as its agency (Chris Hani Development Agency), Minister Davies emphasised the importance of creating opportunities for more people to play in the manufacturing sector.</p>
The Minister referred to the Black Industrialists Programme which aims to increase role players in the manufacturing sector
<p>To date, the programme has supported 22 black industrialists and created 1 500 jobs with R1.5 billion being injected to support the industrialists.</p>
<p>The Komani project is the fourth industrial park to be launched this year and is anticipated to create more jobs for the locals and boost the local economies.</p>
<p>Minister Davies added that to date, the four launched parks combined employ almost 40 000 people.</p>

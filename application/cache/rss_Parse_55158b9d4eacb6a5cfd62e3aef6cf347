<p>The eThekwini Municipality&#8217;s mini-bus taxi incentive programme, called “Moja Cruise” kicked off on Monday after months of behind the scenes collaboration between the Ethekwini Metro Taxi Council (EMTC) &#8211; the leadership body of the mini-bus taxi industry &#8211; and the city.</p>
<p>The roll-out of the 150 taxis part of an innovative pilot programme to “test the waters” for improved public transport system. The programme branded “Moja Cruise” was launched in October 2017, and the various stakeholders have been planning and preparing for the “go live” date this month.</p>
<p>Essentially the pilot programme includes 500 mini-bus taxis that will be branded as “Moja Cruise” taxis, with 150 taxis already enrolled in the programme. These taxis will adhere to certain criteria to offer a clean, safe, efficient, customer-oriented service to the public. The vehicles will be monitored to ensure that these criteria are met in order to qualify for the financial incentive.
As part of the transformation of public transport, the municipality started the construction of road infrastructure in its efforts to integrate public transport into a network of eight bus rapid transit lanes and a rail route across the City in its GO!Durban programme.</p>
<p>As part of this programme, and prior to beginning construction in 2013, the city leadership, since 2009, has been engaging with the leadership of the mini-bus taxi and bus industry in an endeavour to bring these current public transport operators into a cohesive operation to provide safe, efficient and reliable transport for all.</p>
<p>The aim has always been to ensure that they continue to have a stake in public transport into its transformation.</p>
<p>Speaking at the “go live” launch, which was attended by the leadership of the eThekwini Metro Taxi Council and participants of the programme, the executive committee member and chairperson for the Human Settlements and Infrastructure Committee, Mondli Mthembu said that the aim of the programme was to proactively empower the mini-bus taxi industry at all levels, to progress their businesses, and to support the development of the industry towards a more formal and scheduled service structure aimed at providing better levels of services and safety to commuters and improving overall public transport in the city.</p>
<p>Commenting on the EMTC’s collaboration with the city, the chairperson of the eThekwini Metro Taxi Council, B M Nzuza said: “Being experienced public transport operators, we understand and acknowledge the need for a more customer-orientated service that meets the needs of the commuters. By working in collaboration with the eThekwini Municipality, we have been able to offer our expertise and understanding in a consultative and collaborative process, to find positive and workable solutions to the challenges that we face as businesses and they as government. We all look forward to seeing the programme work, and to an improved service and business model for our constituents.”</p>

<p>Giving a keynote address, eThekwini Mayor, Zandile Gumede congratulated eThekwini Officials and the EMTC.</p>
<p>&#8220;It goes without saying that accountability and compliance in terms of moving forward with public transport is vital, however, an improved customer-focussed service means better business and stimulation for the economy. As government, the more we can drive the economy forward to create opportunities, the better it is for the citizens of this country,” she said.</p>
<p>The pilot programme will run for six months and will include 500 vehicles. The 150 taxis involved in the parade have already been enrolled in the programme. The number of taxis will increase to 6 000 once the pilot is assessed and the council approves the full adoption of the programme.<br />
The fees for trips in the taxis, will not differ from that of non-branded taxis, and they will continue to operate in their licensed routes as per usual.<br />
Commuters will eventually be able to rate their trips in a Moja Cruise taxi as part of the overall offering to ensure that the relevant criteria are met by the taxi owner and the driver.</p>

The Presidency said in a statement after the meeting: “The President and the Chancellor also agreed on the importance of continuing with the G20 Compact with Africa initiative, and committed to an expansion of trade and investment between South Africa and Germany.”</p>
<p>Attending the G20 German Africa Investment Summit on 30 October 2018, a stone’s throw from the iconic Brandenburger Gate, once of a symbol of the divide between East and West, Ramaphosa was one of the three keynote speakers addressing the conference in his position as Co-Chair of the G20-Africa Advisory Group, declaring that “Africa is open for business.” The other speakers were Chancellor Angela Merkel and Rwanda’s President Paul Kagame.</p>
<p>Before the summit on Tuesday morning, Ramaphosa met with some key German business people over breakfast. German business, normally conservative investors and not great risk takers were impressed by Ramaphosa, whom they see as a businessman and “one of us”. There are 600 German businesses in South Africa, creating about 100,000 jobs.</p>
<p>Professor Wolfram Scharff, since 2005 one of South Africa’s honorary consuls from Dresden said after the meeting that: “What he said was solid, it was very convincing and very clear, logical and sustainable. I think everyone sitting at at the table this morning was absolutely excited.”</p>
<p>“It was very clear what he wanted, there were clear statements about the security situation, clear statements on how to ensure security for investments. I think it was convincing,” Scharff who has invested in South Africa and attracted investments from as far away as Kazakhstan to South Africa, said.</p>
<p>A fortnight ago Ramaphosa’s special envoy, former Finance Minister Trevor Manuel was already in Berlin, holding talks to attract investments and allay fears about land expropriation.</p>
<p>Scharff was echoing the sentiments of many participants when he said: “The difficulties facing new investments, down there has to do a bit more with the fear what is happening there. And I think it has already become much better in the last few months. I believe the turnaround is coming, that’s my impression and I think one has every chance of going in a positive direction in South Africa. We have to wait for the election but I’m confident.”</p>
<p>Not everyone in Germany shares his positive view and the German Foreign Office’s new Africa drive policy. At a recent closed-door meeting on South Africa attended by many former German diplomats, there were verbal clashes when some expressed their severe disillusionment with the African continent, including South Africa with one telling me “It is a lost continent”.</p>

At a recent closed-door meeting on South Africa attended by many former German diplomats, there were verbal clashes when some expressed their severe disillusionment with the African continent, including South Africa with one telling me “It is a lost continent”.</p>
<p>For decades Germany was South Africa’s biggest overall trading partner, resisting the call for sanctions of the apartheid state in the 1980’s to keep its companies in South Africa.</p>
<p>In 2010 it lost its prime position to China before last year dropping to its current third place behind the United States.</p>
<p>Most major German international companies are in South Africa which they have for decades seen as the “bridge to Africa”. Among the big players are Siemens, ThyssenKrupp and SAP, the car industry with BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes Benz and pharmaceutical companies like Bayer.</p>
<p>In November 2015 Jacob Zuma paid a state visit to the Federal Republic of Germany. At that time, it was registered with some alarm by the political and economic classes in Berlin that the government in Pretoria was increasingly looking to Moscow, Beijing and other BRICS countries to strengthen their economic relations and was no longer focusing on Europe.</p>
<p>Still South African exports to Germany increased by just over 16% increase from 2016 to 2017 to 7.2-billion euros, which narrowed the trade deficit. In 2016 over 300,000 German tourists visited South Africa.</p>
<p>Scharff said that “in Germany there is a very, very long tradition with South Africa especially in the western federal states (the former West Germany). I think there is a big mass – there is not so much that moves in one direction or the other. In the long term it is a stable relationship that is going very well – sure, you have sometimes more fear and anxiety, sometimes less and sometimes things tend to run more or less smoothly. But if you look at the big players things are stable – there are some problems but nothing major in principle. The problems are home made.”<br />
Among the home made problems he identifies difficulties with getting visas and work permits.<br />
Scharff, who himself is based in Dresden, in Saxony in the former East Germany, rather sees the problems for investors from the former East Germany, that are mostly SME’s (Small and Medium Enterprises). These companies specialise in new water technologies, bio-technology, IT, electronics, software development, all areas that Scharff believes are also of interest for South African partners. However, unlike the big enterprises the risks are often too high for them to invest.</p>
<p>Scharff suggests that there should be more focus on SME cooperation between German and South African partners that would include internships and trainee programmes for South Africans in Germany.</p>
<p>Others at the meeting suggested that if one of the big players would do a major investment, it would be sending a signal to other to follow.</p>
<p>The summit under the patronage of German Chancellor Merkel and organised by the German-African Business Association saw 12 African heads of state and government meet in Berlin to improve investment conditions in selected African states. It is part of the “Compact with Africa” initiative which was launched during the German G20 presidency last year. The longer-term goal is to boost African economic growth, infrastructure, create jobs and thus curb illegal migration from Africa to Europe.</p>
<p>Merkel in her address said that it was time to start focusing on Africa as the next boom region after Asia.</p>
<p>”The Compact with Africa follows a different, a new approach – it is about an equal footing type of partnership, aiming to be long-lasting and benefit all equally,” she said</p>
<p>“Apart from strengthening Africa as a location for investment, it is also important to establish fair trade relations between Europe and Africa,” said Merkel.</p>
<p>She also announced a one-billion euro investment fund that should especially benefit SME’s.</p>
<p>The investment fund was proposed by the Africa Association of German Business. “If we succeed in using the one-billion euros as an effective lever to launch many more projects in African countries, this can be a milestone,” said chairperson Stefan Liebing, calling Merkel’s announcement “almost historic”. It is virtually only large German corporations that operate on the African continent as the German SME’s hardly dare to enter this risky market.</p>
<p>Since the former ANC Chief Whip, Stone Sizani arrived in Germany in late 2016 as South Africa’s Ambassador to Germany, he has been ceaselessly trying to attract investments but faced difficulties during the Zuma presidency. Speaking two weeks ago at a Mandela 100 event held in the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, the political foundation of the current junior ruling coalition partner the SPD (Social Democratic Party), Sizani said: “It has been difficult (attracting new investments) before December last year and it has been difficult afterwards. When I first came, business people told me to wait for last December to see what happens. Then when that happened and we got a new president, they told me wait for next year’s elections. We are tired of waiting.”</p>
<p>During the last year of the Zuma presidency Sizani surprised many in political Berlin and German business in meetings with his frank, no-holds barred views on the situation back in South Africa He was at that stage still a member of the ANC NEC.</p>
<p>At a National Day gathering in the embassy in April 2017 he went off script, pleading with his guests “The situation we face in South Africa is not forever, please stay with us.”</p>
<p>South Africa’s chief diplomats in Berlin have had a difficult time in the last few years selling the country as an attractive investment option.</p>
<p>Before Sizani became ambassador the embassy was without a chief diplomat for nearly 10 months in 2016. His predecessor, Makhenkesi Arnold Stofile, a former Minister of Sports and Mbeki supporter, also had a more difficult time in Berlin. Stofile was further handicapped by the fact that for part of his tenure the Consul-General in Munich, the heartland of the strong Bavarian industry, was a close Zuma confidante.</p>
<p>The consul-general’s tenure was marked by non-diplomatic staff resignations and damaging relations with businesses. A disciplinary report on her shenanigans in the Consulate according to insiders at the time apparently kept on slipping to the bottom of the pile for Stofile to sign off on. He apparently realised to do so at the time would have been political suicide.</p>
<p>Instead, he still had to play host to president Zuma on an official, tense state visit to Germany in November 2015. He got his own back. At his farewell a month later in the Embassy he introduced “one of my favourite people in South Africa at the moment and my guest of honour tonight”. It was Thuli Madonsela, at that stage still the Public Protector.</p>
<p>The days leading up to his farewell was drama-filled as the Minister of Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa was supposed to be present as diplomatic decorum dictates at such events. Mthethwa was already in The Hague when he cancelled at the last minute, which meant that the German representative also had to be downgraded.</p>
<p>As part of the inaugural Africa Investment Forum in Johannesburg from 7 to 9 November 2018, hosted by South Africa and the African Development Bank, South Africa and Germany will also host the annual Compact with Africa Investor Event on the morning of 8 November.</p>
<p>South African diplomats in Berlin have indicated that their efforts and the Trevor Manuel blitz visit and now the Ramaphosa effect has already started to bear fruit with some investments in the pipeline.</p>
<p>The German newspaper Die Welt, in an opinion piece on the African investment summit, took up Scharff’s point: “The question remains whether the approach will be sufficient to persuade conservative, sometimes risk-averse German SMEs to invest in Africa and develop business opportunities there.</p>
<p>“I believe: no. Not a single company will therefore start new investments in Africa, because in future the tax systems will work better there, or the customs administrations. Instead, we need movement in two completely different areas.”</p>
<p>Those areas the paper argued will be: “Firstly, we need a new form of private-public distribution of risk when it comes to opening up new and risky markets. Mid-sized companies do not need and do not want subsidies for their business in Africa. What they need is the certainty that the federal government supports them when major problems arise.” Among the major problems the paper cites are ownership disputes and non-payments.</p>
<p>The paper goes on to state that “secondly, Germany must become more visible in Africa”. Compared to former colonial powers like the UK and France, Germany hardly has a presence on the continent, the paper argues.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<img width="210" height="158" src="https://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ETHIOPIA-210x158.jpg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="" style="float: left; margin-right: 5px;" /><p>The reform agenda under Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, which has received nods and political acclaim globally, has radically broken the mould not only in the Ethiopian context but also in the African and global political spheres. It has indeed been a series of transformative firsts for Ethiopia since Abiy Ahmed took the helm following the resignation of Hailemariam Desalegn in February 2018. At 41, Abiy Ahmed is the youngest head of government in Africa and the first Oromo (the majority ethnic group in Ethiopia) to lead the country.</p>
<p>It all began with the lifting of the state of emergency that had been imposed in February 2018 following waves of anti-government protests in the Oromia region. The lift was followed by the release of more than 2000 political prisoners who had been detained in a government crackdown of protesters and the adoption of a law that ensures amnesty for former detainees. In the same vein, the government also lifted the “terrorist designation” of three groups while promising engagement on reform of the legislative framework including the anti-terrorism laws and an overhaul of the justice system. The protests, which started in 2016, begun in the Oromia region but soon spread to other regions, as the Oromos decried their marginalisation and political exclusion for years at the hands of a Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) government, which has been dominated by the Tigrayan minority.

The Ethiopian government announced that it would comply with the 2000 Algiers Agreement, which had settled the 1998-2000 Eritrean-Ethiopian border war. In July 2018, the Ethiopian prime minister and Eritrean president, Isaias Afwerki, signed a full peace agreement which realised the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two states, the opening of embassies, resumption of flight services, connection of ports and re-institution of telecommunication services. The peace deal has serious implications for the geopolitics of the Horn of Africa as Ethiopia moves to reinforce its status as regional hegemon in light of growing strategic interests of key powers for Red Sea ports and the regional competition for influence among the Middle Eastern axes.

It has indeed been a series of transformative firsts for Ethiopia since Abiy Ahmed took the helm following the resignation of Hailemariam Desalegn in February 2018. At 41, Abiy Ahmed is the youngest head of government in Africa and the first Oromo (the majority ethnic group in Ethiopia) to lead the country.</p>
<p>It all began with the lifting of the state of emergency that had been imposed in February 2018 following waves of anti-government protests in the Oromia region. The lift was followed by the release of more than 2000 political prisoners who had been detained in a government crackdown of protesters and the adoption of a law that ensures amnesty for former detainees.

The prime minister also announced plans to liberalise the economy by opening up major state-run sectors of the economy to private domestic and foreign investment, a significant break from the economic model that has prioritised deep state involvement in the economy.</p>
<p>The reforms extended to the state security and intelligence services in a reshuffle of the heads of the armed forces and the air force with the promise of ensuring a more ethnically balanced security sector.<br />
Abiy’s pursuit of Pax Ethiopia culminated in the Eritrean-Ethiopian rapprochement, bringing to an end the two decades-long animosity between the two countries. The Ethiopian government announced that it would comply with the 2000 Algiers Agreement, which had settled the 1998-2000 Eritrean-Ethiopian border war. In July 2018, the Ethiopian prime minister and Eritrean president, Isaias Afwerki, signed a full peace agreement which realised the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two states, the opening of embassies, resumption of flight services, connection of ports and re-institution of telecommunication services. The peace deal has serious implications for the geopolitics of the Horn of Africa as Ethiopia moves to reinforce its status as regional hegemon in light of growing strategic interests of key powers for Red Sea ports and the regional competition for influence among the Middle Eastern axes. Consequently, Ethiopia has employed a delicate balancing act to attract foreign investment while playing a safe foreign policy strategy: courting both the Qatar-Turkey and Arab axes while simultaneously strengthening ties with the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>A bold move for gender parity saw the appointment of a new cabinet with half of positions filled by women. The restructuring of the cabinet, which was trimmed down, further resulted in the creation of new ministry, the Ministry of Peace, which will oversee the federal police, the intelligence services and the information security agency and take the lead in handling the ethnic tensions and violence that have persisted in Ethiopia’s political landscape. Another positive reinforcement to Abiy’s transformative agenda saw the appointment of Ethiopia’s first female president, Sahle-Work Zewde, disrupting a deeply patriarchal political culture and opening up the space for gender inclusivity and women empowerment in Ethiopian society.</p>
<p>Before Abiy’s tenure, political violence was mostly vertical, directed at the state but upon his assumption of power, the tensions have taken on a horizontal nature with fighting across various ethnic groups. For instance, in recent weeks, there have been reports of clashes between regional forces and civilians in the country’s Somali region and attacks on other ethnic minorities in the West Guiji zone of Oromia.</p>
<p>Quelling long-running ethnic tensions to build a unified, national constituency is just one of the many challenges that the prime minister has to overcome in his quest for change. On 10 October, a group of protesting soldiers marched unannounced to the prime minister’s office to demand better pay. Although the prime minister was able to defuse the situation with the soldiers using unusual tactics, the attempted mutiny points to much grander machinations to impair Abiy’s reform agenda. Abiy will also have to craftily navigate the coalitional party politics of the EPRDF and ensure that an elite bargain remains in place among the four main ethnic parties while addressing the divisive issue that threaten party unity. These issues range from intra-party issues including mistrust and a disgruntled TPLF following its dislodge from power to national issues like land ownership, age-old ethnic tensions and lack of consensus on the federal political vision for Ethiopia.</p>
<p>In retrospect, one has to appreciate the Ethiopian exceptionalism that holds its special place in African history: as the only African country to have never been colonised. Linked to this is the fact that Addis Ababa is a diplomatic hub of the continent, hosting the headquarters of the African Union (AU) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA). Ethiopia is also the top contributor of troops to UN peacekeeping. It is undeniable that the changes have been long overdue and are a welcome reprieve for the millions of Ethiopians who have clung onto decades-old hope for a better future.</p>
<p>Abiy Ahmed certainly cuts the figure of the “political messiah” that the African political leadership enterprise is badly in need of. The question arises whether this Abyssinian wave of reform will spread across the breadth and width of Africa and in effect, re-awaken the continental resolve and democratic yearnings for African renaissance. Six months is a bit too early to tell; only time will give us an answer.</p>

In its 2018 report, Allianz focused in on the imbalances that exist between the average wealth held per capita compared to the median wealth per capita, noting that there are more countries (30 in total) in which distribution, based on development of median assets, has improved since the turn of the millennium.
This shows an overall improvement in the wealth of any given country – however, South Africa is not one of those.
South Africa, Allianz said, is a country with a reputation for distorted wealth distribution, and has shown a very high negative growth differential between average and median wealth – beaten only by the US and Indonesia.
If the rankings were listed by median wealth rather than average wealth, South Africa would drop 7 places (to be ranked 44th out of 53), the group said, “an indication of relatively unequal distribution of wealth”.
Inequality
“To obtain a nuanced picture of national distribution in an international context, the group introduced a new indicator in its report, the Allianz Wealth Equity Indicator (AWEI).
“Some of the results are surprising. Along with the ‘usual suspects’ of the US, South Africa, Indonesia and the UK, countries where the distribution of wealth is relatively strongly distorted also include Denmark, Sweden and Germany.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>In Scandinavia this may be primarily due to high debt levels among large parts of the population; in Germany, the country‘s delayed reunification and the general shortage of capital-funded pension schemes play a crucial part, the group said.
“On the other hand, those countries where wealth distribution is relatively balanced include many eastern and western European countries, some of which are euro crisis countries such as Italy, Spain and Greece.”
Even if the last few years of crisis and austerity may have led to greater inequality in the last two countries in particular, they still have a relatively solid base to fall back on, as assets have traditionally been very widely distributed – not least when it comes to real estate assets.
“We should therefore be wary of drawing hasty or generalised conclusions about wealth distribution. Apart from the US, barely any country conforms to the cliché of a wealth distribution that is already extremely distorted but is still getting worse.”
This is the global ranking:  </p>

For others, blockchain represents an incredible chance to shake things up, thanks to the opportunities offered by digital currencies and blockchain technology.
If you fall into that latter category, you should already have heard about the annual Blockchain Africa Conferences, the first of their kind in Africa, which is now entering its fifth year.
To date, they’ve hosted four highly successful and sold-out blockchain conferences in Cape Town and Johannesburg, and have attracted big names such as Vinny Lingham (well-known South African entrepreneur, Founder and CEO of Gyft and Civic in the US), Brock Pierce (Founder of Block Capital and early adopter of bitcoin in the US), Andreas M. Antonopoulos (author of several bitcoin and Ethereum books), William Frentzen (Federal Prosecutor with the US Attorney’s Office) and Stefan Thomas (CTO of Ripple in the US).</p>
<p></p>
<p>The annual Blockchain Africa Conferences have attracted international experts and thought leaders in the blockchain arena.
These great minds have shared their insights around blockchain technology’s opportunities and challenges, as well as the latest trends seen around the world.
The conferences have also provided a platform for attendees to network with like-minded individuals and learn about some of the most interesting blockchain use cases from a range of innovative companies and start-ups.
Here at home, the African continent has massive challenges with transactions and doing business that, with the help of blockchain technology, can be transformed into simpler and more efficient ways of working. The Blockchain Africa Conference 2019 will focus on moving Africa forward with the technology. It will discuss how the blockchain can simplify systems and processes to lower costs, reduce fraud, become highly secure and transparent, and remove human error and inefficiencies.
There will be two conferences next year – one in Johannesburg from February 28 through to March 1, and another in Cape Town on March 6.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tickets for both conferences are still available, ranging from the Start-Up Ticket through to the Executive Ticket. In addition, sponsorship opportunities still exist, should your business wish to join the likes of Rand Merchant Bank and Luno.
Luno’s co-founder and CEO, Marcus Swanepoel, will also be speaking at the Cape Town conference:</p>
<p></p>
<p>You’d be hard-pressed to find a more authoritative voice on the matter than Marcus. Before co-founding Luno, Marcus worked for Standard Chartered in Singapore, and 3i and Morgan Stanley in London. He holds an MBA from INSEAD, is a qualified Chartered Accountant and CFA charter holder.

<p>The report measures and assesses the competitiveness landscape of 140 economies, and gives insights into what drives economic growth among them.</p>
<p>This is done through assigning scores to various indicators across 12 key pillars – starting with a country’s institutions, all the way through to the business dynamics.</p>
<p>In 2018, South Africa ranked 67th globally – with an overall score of 60.8 – attaining the second spot in Sub-Saharan Africa. This is down five places from 62nd place in 2017.</p>
<p>According to the WEF, among its strengths, South Africa is home to a large market size (68.4), good infrastructure (68.6) and a well-developed financial system (82.1, 18th).</p>
<p>More specifically, South Africa’s financial sector offers a relatively balanced access to various sources of finance, including credit (100.0, 11th), venture capital (33.0, 63rd), equity (100.0, 2nd) and insurance (100.0, 3rd).</p>
<p>In addition, South Africa’s innovation capability is relatively advanced (44.3, 46th), although limited by insufficient research and development (37.5).</p>
<p>Among its weaknesses, however, South Africa’s performances on the health pillar (43.2, 125th) and security (43.7, 132nd) sub-pillar are among the worst in the world.</p>
<p>Driven by high incidence of communicable diseases and high rate of homicides (34 per hundred population, 135th), these factors are major challenges for the economic and human development of the country.</p>
<p>Low ICT adoption (46.1, 85th) is another important restraint on South Africa’s competitiveness. Only 54% of the adult population has access to the internet, and only 70 out of 100 people have subscribed to mobile-broadband services (66th).</p>
<p>Similarly, the digital skills (116th) and critical thinking skills (78th) of the current workforce are inadequate for the progress of a successful economy in the Fourth Industrial Revolution</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p> The bad news</p>
<p>Among the 98 individual indicators measured by the WEF, South Africa ranks in the lowest quartile (bottom 35 countries) in 13 categories, which emerge as the main factors dragging us down the competitiveness rankings.</p>
<p>According to the WEF’s assessment, much of what’s holding South Africa back competitively has to do with labour and crime – particularly the high rate of murder coupled with an unreliable police force, and the friction between labour and employers that often results in protracted strikes which bring industries to a halt.</p>
<p>Other factors dragging us down the rankings include a lack of digital skills, poor education, and poor healthcare.</p>

<p><strong>South Africa and crime</strong></p>
<p>The WEF mentions South Africa in two very specific contexts relating to competitiveness – namely security and inequality: two areas South Africa puts in the worst performance.</p>
<p>Globally, performance among all countries is best on Security. Here, the median score is 72 and half of all countries score 75 or above, with Finland (97.5) coming closest to being free from terrorism and crime.</p>
<p>With equal scores of 33.8, El Salvador and Venezuela are the worst performers, but crime and violence extract a huge economic and human toll across Latin America. The continent’s largest economies—Brazil (45.8), Mexico (46.0) and Colombia (43.5)—are less than halfway to the frontier.</p>
<p>Nigeria, Yemen, South Africa, Pakistan and the Philippines are other countries with notable problems related to violence, crime or terrorism, and where the police are considered unreliable.</p>
<p>Across all countries, the relationship between the prevalence of organised crime and the perceived reliability of the police is strikingly close.</p>
<p><strong>South Africa and poverty</strong></p>
<p>South Africa is also the most unequal country in the world, the WEF said.</p>
<p>“The incidence of extreme poverty is an important measure of broad-based economic progress, and low productivity is its proximate cause: the poor produce too little to earn a wage to subsist let alone to invest in healthcare and education,” it said.</p>
<p>“That’s why higher competitiveness scores are typically associated with lower poverty.”</p>
<p>Only two countries in the top half of the GCI rankings – South Africa and India – demonstrate what is considered an extreme poverty incidence, in which the poverty rate exceeds 10% of the total population.</p>
<p><strong>The good news</strong></p>
<p>Negative factors aside, there are also 20 indicators where South Africa ranks in the top quartile (top 35 countries).</p>
<p>These factors centre around the strong financial markets, low costs of doing business in South Africa compared to other countries, and the strong rights and freedoms we enjoy.</p>
<p>With solid regulations, and relatively stable infrastructure, South Africa does have some major draws – which makes it the second most competitive country in Sub-Saharan Africa (below Mauritius).</p>

It is this single factor instilled in individuals since childhood that has contributed to stereotyping and prejudice across societies and cultures. Stories have instigated wars and political mudslinging, racial segregation and gender discrimination, generational and cross-country hostility, and bitterness between low and high-income communities.
Even Africa is perceived in a certain way because of the stories being told about it. The role of traditional media and social media are key players in the way the world views Africa, and possibly contributes to putting the brakes on the continent’s development.
How do the stories we disseminate shape how the rest of the world views Africa? How does it affect foreign investment? How does it influence markets and economic output? These are some of the questions we should be asking, along with how to change our one-sided approach.
Even research indicates that attitudes and views have been shaped in a specific manner.</p>
<p>Influence
The US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), for example, explored the neurobiology of listening to stories and how attitudes and behaviours can change. It found that storytelling changes views about people for the better or worse and significantly influences societies.</p>
<p>“Narrative exerts a powerful influence on human thoughts and behaviour. They consolidate memory, shape emotions, cue heuristics and biases in judgment, influence in-group/out-group distinctions, and may affect the fundamental content of personal identity,” it states.
Meanwhile Octavia Utley’s curriculum at the Yale-New Haven Teacher’s Institute explored this tradition in Africa. She found that storytelling throughout history made it possible for African cultures to pass on knowledge, history and experiences from one generation to the next, manifesting itself in different ways and serving many purposes.</p>
<p>“It was used to interpret the universe, resolve natural and physical phenomena, teach morals, maintain culture values, pass on methods of survival and praise God,” said Utley in her paper titled, Keeping the tradition of African storytelling alive.</p>
<p>This data tells us that a story is not just a story. Narratives have shaped societies, and the world has been significantly affected by the stories we have told about each other. Collectively we have all in some way contributed to bias stories without due consideration of its consequences.</p>
<p>So how do we change our views from what was instilled in us as children, and how do we ensure the next generation do not stereotype others?</p>
<p>Perceptions
There are many layers to unravel and now is the time to review our attitudes and perceptions of others. We need to challenge our internal and exported narrative because this is where behavior change begins. Parents, in particular, need to be mindful about the type of stories they tell their children, and be aware of books they are reading.</p>

<p>This interchange is designed to provide continuous access to the Verulam, Phoenix, Mount Edgecombe, uMhlanga Ridge Town Centre and the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast.</p>
<p>Corné Roux, the Eastern Region project manager for SANRAL said that the biggest challenge was accommodating the traffic during construction.</p>
<p>“The interchange sits on a major national road, the N2, and the M41 feeds major residential, industrial and commercial areas such as Phoenix, Mt Edgecombe and uMhlanga carrying high volumes of traffic which had to be kept moving during the interchange’s construction,&#8221; said Roux.</p>
<p>He added that another challenge was the ground conditions that needed the installation of extensive piling to support the interchange structures.</p>
<p>Despite the lengthy construction period and disruptions on this busy stretch of road, motorists are now feeling the benefits of the interchange which has dramatically improved traffic flow through the area.</p>
<p>The new roads have state-of-the-art lighting making the intersection safer and more visible at night while the pedestrian bridge also makes it safer and more convenient for people to cross the N2.</p>
<p>According to Roux, the Mount Edgecombe Interchange is now a landmark structure and an important artery of the greater eThekwini metropolitan highway system for easing traffic, relieving congestion and is also a significant business enabler.</p>
<p>Managing Director of Tongaat Hulett Developments Michael Deighton said, “Not only has the new interchange improved driving conditions in this previously congested area but it will also unlock significant development opportunities planned for the KwaZulu-Natal north coast&#8221;.</p>

<p>This interchange is designed to provide continuous access to the Verulam, Phoenix, Mount Edgecombe, uMhlanga Ridge Town Centre and the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast.</p>
<p>Corné Roux, the Eastern Region project manager for SANRAL said that the biggest challenge was accommodating the traffic during construction.</p>
<p>“The interchange sits on a major national road, the N2, and the M41 feeds major residential, industrial and commercial areas such as Phoenix, Mt Edgecombe and uMhlanga carrying high volumes of traffic which had to be kept moving during the interchange’s construction,&#8221; said Roux.</p>
<p>He added that another challenge was the ground conditions that needed the installation of extensive piling to support the interchange structures.</p>
<p>Despite the lengthy construction period and disruptions on this busy stretch of road, motorists are now feeling the benefits of the interchange which has dramatically improved traffic flow through the area.</p>
<p>The new roads have state-of-the-art lighting making the intersection safer and more visible at night while the pedestrian bridge also makes it safer and more convenient for people to cross the N2.</p>
<p>According to Roux, the Mount Edgecombe Interchange is now a landmark structure and an important artery of the greater eThekwini metropolitan highway system for easing traffic, relieving congestion and is also a significant business enabler.</p>
<p>Managing Director of Tongaat Hulett Developments Michael Deighton said, “Not only has the new interchange improved driving conditions in this previously congested area but it will also unlock significant development opportunities planned for the KwaZulu-Natal north coast&#8221;.</p>

<p>The draft, aimed at setting ownership and transformation targets for the sector, was opposed by the industry even though it acknowledged that the current document was in many respects an improvement on the previous one proposed by Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe’s predecessor Mosebenzi Zwane.</p>
<p>The draft charter had a requirement of 10% ‘free carry’ interest for mining communities and employees on new mining rights as part of the proposed 30% black equity ownership target.</p>
<p>The contents of the bill will have an effect on trade union Solidarity’s current strike against white employees being excluded from Sasol’s Khanyisa share scheme.</p>

		<title>SOUTH AFRICA LOOKS TO KICKSTART ITS BIOFUELS INDUSTRY</title>

<p>A net importer of crude, Africa’s most industrialised economy wants biofuels initially to meet two percent, or about 400 million litres, of the country’s annual fuel consumption to wean itself off oil imports and improve the trade balance.</p>
<p>However, regulatory uncertainty centred on financial support incentives to manufacturers has choked investment since the approval of a national biofuels strategy in 2007.</p>
<p>“The department will be tabling this biofuel framework to cabinet for its consideration and approval before end of March 2019,” said Jeff Radebe in a speech prepared for an energy conference in Cape Town.</p>
<p>The framework deals with, among other things, the mandatory purchase of biofuels by licensed manufacturers and feedstock plans that do not compromise food security, said Radebe.

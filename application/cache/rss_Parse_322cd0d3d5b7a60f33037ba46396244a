		<title>The Rock&#8217;s new motivational app may finally get you into the gym</title>

<p>Now the former wrestler turned movie action hero has decided to turn his weekly habit into an app called The Rock Clock.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The free app is fairly simple in that it works as a goal tracker and alarm clock.</p>
The unique part comes via the very personal involvement of The Rock in the fabric of the app itself
<p>Each wake up alarm sound (25 in all) was selected by The Rock and even the menus are written in style of the actor&#8217;s own words, with prompts like &#8220;Wake my ass up at [select a time].&#8221;</p>
<p>One alarm sound is actually the actor&#8217;s own voice, humorously saying &#8220;beep, beep, beep,&#8221; along with a funny quip in the middle of the vocal droning.</p>

You can also opt to sync your wake up alarm with The Rock&#8217;s own wake up schedule
<p>However, since one of his most recent wake up times was 4:30 a.m., this particular feature is probably not for the casual fan.</p>
<p>The app also delivers regular personal video messages from The Rock in the same style as many of his social media posts, but focused solely on motivational messages.</p>
The Rock teased the app about a week ago on Instagram, and it&#8217;s just one part of a new motivational initiative he&#8217;s launching called Project Rock
<p>In addition to the app, the actor is also offering Project Rock apparel through his deal with Under Armour.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve spent over a year engineering this app for you,&#8221; wrote The Rock on Instagram on Monday. &#8220;Our goal was create a free, direct, uncomplicated, cool, motivating app to help us all get after our goals every morning.  I also wanted to totally disrupt the traditional &#8216;morning alarm&#8217; system we all use on our phones.&#8221;</p>
The Rock has maintained a direct social media relationship with his fans long before the app, so keeping the personal message content going from his side shouldn&#8217;t be problem
<p>The question now is whether or not the muscle-bound entertainer&#8217;s daily encouragement will actually result in real app-powered personal progress for his fans.</p>
<p>The app is currently available for both iOS and Android.</p>

<p>Health meets technology, here are the best apps and wearables for calorie count and fitness:</p>
Best fitness trackers for calorie counting &#8211; Jawbone UP3
<p>&#160;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jawbone&#8217;s latest wearable, the UP3 is packed full of some of the most advanced sensors in the space, which means it takes measuring your calorie burn each day.</p>
<p>UP3 tries to take out the guesswork, using data about your height, weight, activity intensity and duration from its huge range of sensors.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
Under Armour HealthBox
<p>&#160;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The HealthBox is made up of the Under Armour Band fitness tracker, heart rate monitor chest strap and smart scales. You can step on the scales and the in formation will be combined with your food logging data.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
Best apps for calorie counting- MyFitnessPal app
<p>&#160;</p>
<p></p>
<p>MyFitnessPal app (iOS, Android, Blackberry, Windows) is leagues ahead of the rest when it comes to calorie counting and diet management. It has your vitals and what you want to achieve &#8211; gain, lose or maintain weight .</p>
<p>MyFitnessPal estimates how many calories your body burns without additional exercise. It&#8217;s then your job to log everything you eat and drink.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
Best for coaching: HAPIcoach
<p>&#160;</p>
<p></p>
<p>HAPIcoach app claims to get you eating better in just five days. The idea is to take photos of what you eat, logging at least 10 meals over those five days.</p>
<p>A nutrition expert will then be able to analyse your eating habits and gradually over time help you make substantial and worthwhile changes with your diet.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
Best for fitness trackers: Lose It!
<p>&#160;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Like MyFitnessPal, it&#8217;s built around deciding how much weight you want to lose. Then you&#8217;re given a daily calorie budget to work from. It uses your phone to scan barcodes to log meals and will calculate how many calories you&#8217;ll burn from a session in the gym.</p>
<p>It also takes into consideration all the other factors that can affect a diet such as sleep and your macronutrients intake.</p>

<p>HAPIcoach app claims to get you eating better in just five days. The idea is to take photos of what you eat, logging at least 10 meals over those five days.</p>
<p>A nutrition expert will then be able to analyse your eating habits and gradually over time help you make substantial and worthwhile changes with your diet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center"><strong>Best for fitness trackers: Lose It!</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like MyFitnessPal, it&#8217;s built around deciding how much weight you want to lose. Then you&#8217;re given a daily calorie budget to work from. It uses your phone to scan barcodes to log meals and will calculate how many calories you&#8217;ll burn from a session in the gym.</p>
<p>It also takes into consideration all the other factors that can affect a diet such as sleep and your macronutrients intake.</p>
<p>Keeping things social is a big part of how Lose It! works. You can join groups, share your favourite meals and enter challenges to keep you motivated.</p>

If you have one of these five signs, you should book an appointment to have your throat examined by a doctor.</p>
<p>A sore throat is a common health complaint, especially amongst children. While most sore throats are a result of a cold or flu virus, hay fever or other allergies, they can also be a symptom of a more serious conditions. The South African Pharmacist&#8217;s Assistant recommends seeing a doctor as soon as possible if any of these factors apply to you:</p>
<p>1. Swelling of the neck and/or tongue</p>
<p>Swelling and pain in the neck is often the result of inflamed or enlarged lymph glands, the NHS explains. Lymph glands (also called nodes) often swell in response to an infection in the body. Swollen glands can be caused by tonsilitis, glandular fever and even the common cold. Unfortunately, glandular inflammation can also be a symptom of cancer, HIV, lupus and syphilis.</p>
<p>As in the neck, swelling in the tongue coupled with a sore throat is usually caused by an infection such as pharyngitis, tonsilitis, strep throat or laryngitis. Because swelling in the tongue can restrict breathing, it is always best to seek medical treatment immediately.
2. A skin rash</p>
<p>A skin rash along with a sore throat is often an indication of childhood illnesses such as chickenpox, measles and rubella, Medline Plus explains. These conditions can be severe, leading to secondary infections or even death.</p>

<p>3. Fever</p>
<p>A sore throat can often be accompanied by fever &#8211; especially in children suffering from a viral or bacterial infection. In babies and young children, a fever should always be taken seriously. If your child&#8217;s temperature measures over 37°C or you suspect your child has a fever but have no thermometer to measure their temperature, seek medical attention urgently. Untreated fever in babies and young children can result in serious complications such as seizures.</p>
<p>4. Stiff neck</p>
<p>A stiff neck together with a sore throat are signs of meningitis &#8211; a serious, life-threatening infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. Those suffering from meningitis often have difficulty moving their chin towards their chest. Other symptoms can include fever, nausea, vomiting and sensitivity to light.</p>
<p>5. Drooling</p>
<p>Drooling with a sore throat may be a sign that that the sick person is having difficulty swallowing. This should be addressed quickly, especially in children, as difficulty swallowing can result in dehydration and other complications.</p>
<p>Other scenarios that warrant a trip to the doctor:</p>
<p>&#8211; Sore throat lasts longer than seven days or that has not responded to treatment after a week</p>
<p>&#8211; If you are pregnant and notice any other symptoms, especially fever</p>
<p>&#8211; If you suffer from an immune-comprising condition such as diabetes, HIV or cancer</p>
<p>Remember, when in doubt, phone your doctor to see if you need to book an appointment. When it comes to health, it is always best to be safe rather than sorry.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<img width="68" height="68" src="http://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/winter-68x68.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="winter" style="float: left; padding: 15px 15px 15px 0px;" /><p>Winter is here and between swaddling ourselves with scarves and blankets &#8211; who has time for taking care of ourselves?</p>
<p>You do! Resolve to follow these diet, exercise, and lifestyle tips, and you can be good to yourself this winter &#8211; and all year long.</p>
<p>1. Enjoy the Benefits of Yogurt
It&#8217;s creamy smooth, packed with flavor &#8211; and just may be the wonder food you&#8217;ve been craving. Research suggests that that humble carton of yogurt may:</p>
<p>Help prevent osteoporosis
Reduce your risk of high blood pressure
Aid gastrointestinal conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and constipation</p>
<p>Ready to take home a few cartons of yummy yogurt? When buying think low-fat, make sure the yogurt contains active cultures and vitamin D, and keep tabs on sugar content.</p>
<p>2. Help Winter Heartburn
Getting hit with heartburn over the winter stretch? Help is at hand! Try these hints and you can stop the burn before it starts:</p>
<p>Nibble: Enjoy your favorite foods &#8212; but in moderation. No need to heap on the goodies (or go back for seconds and thirds!). Packing your stomach with food makes heartburn much more likely.</p>
<p>Know Your Triggers: Certain foods feed heartburn&#8217;s flame. Typical triggers include foods full of sugar and fat &#8212; think pumpkin pie slathered with whipped cream. Instead reach for complex carbs like veggies and whole-wheat breads &#8212; or at least share that dessert!</p>
<p>Get Up: Stretching out for a nap post-meal is a great way to guarantee you&#8217;ll get reflux. Instead, keep your head higher than your stomach &#8212; or keep right on walking, away from the dinner table and out the door. Light exercise is a great way to prevent heartburn.</p>
<p>3. Kiss Winter Cold Sores Good-bye</p>
<p>If you find you&#8217;re more prone to bust out cold sores (also called fever blisters) during the hectic chilly season, you may be your own worst enemy. That&#8217;s because lack of sleep, too much alcohol or sugar, stress, and close physical contact (think auntie&#8217;s smooches) can all contribute to outbreaks.</p>
<p>So, to help keep your kisser cold-sore-free this year &#8211; or to keep from passing your cold sores to others &#8211; try these tips:</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t overdo the warm comfort food &#8211; maintain a healthy diet.
Get plenty of rest.
Wash your hands.
Don&#8217;t share food or drink containers.
Discard used tissues.
Don&#8217;t kiss on or near anyone&#8217;s cold sore &#8211; and don&#8217;t let them near yours!</p>

<p>You do! Resolve to follow these diet, exercise, and lifestyle tips, and you can be good to yourself this winter &#8211; and all year long.</p>
<p>1. Enjoy the Benefits of Yogurt<br />
It&#8217;s creamy smooth, packed with flavor &#8211; and just may be the wonder food you&#8217;ve been craving. Research suggests that that humble carton of yogurt may:</p>
<p>Help prevent osteoporosis<br />
Reduce your risk of high blood pressure<br />
Aid gastrointestinal conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and constipation</p>
<p>Ready to take home a few cartons of yummy yogurt? When buying think low-fat, make sure the yogurt contains active cultures and vitamin D, and keep tabs on sugar content.</p>
<p>2. Help Winter Heartburn<br />
Getting hit with heartburn over the winter stretch? Help is at hand! Try these hints and you can stop the burn before it starts:</p>
<p>Nibble: Enjoy your favorite foods &#8212; but in moderation. No need to heap on the goodies (or go back for seconds and thirds!). Packing your stomach with food makes heartburn much more likely.</p>
<p>Know Your Triggers: Certain foods feed heartburn&#8217;s flame. Typical triggers include foods full of sugar and fat &#8212; think pumpkin pie slathered with whipped cream. Instead reach for complex carbs like veggies and whole-wheat breads &#8212; or at least share that dessert!</p>
<p>Get Up: Stretching out for a nap post-meal is a great way to guarantee you&#8217;ll get reflux. Instead, keep your head higher than your stomach &#8212; or keep right on walking, away from the dinner table and out the door. Light exercise is a great way to prevent heartburn.</p>
<p>3. Kiss Winter Cold Sores Good-bye</p>
<p>If you find you&#8217;re more prone to bust out cold sores (also called fever blisters) during the hectic chilly season, you may be your own worst enemy. That&#8217;s because lack of sleep, too much alcohol or sugar, stress, and close physical contact (think auntie&#8217;s smooches) can all contribute to outbreaks.</p>
<p>So, to help keep your kisser cold-sore-free this year &#8211; or to keep from passing your cold sores to others &#8211; try these tips:</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t overdo the warm comfort food &#8211; maintain a healthy diet.<br />
Get plenty of rest.<br />
Wash your hands.<br />
Don&#8217;t share food or drink containers.<br />
Discard used tissues.<br />
Don&#8217;t kiss on or near anyone&#8217;s cold sore &#8211; and don&#8217;t let them near yours!</p>

<p>I recently stumbled across the manifesto that Lululemon uses as a mission statement. Regardless of what you think of the company, its manifesto includes some great ideas. Here&#8217;s my simplified, general-purpose version:</p>
<p>• Drink fresh water. It flushes toxins and keeps your brain sharp.</p>
<p>• Exercise daily. The endorphin helps you make better decisions.</p>
<p>• Practice courage. Do at least one thing a day that frightens you.</p>
<p>• Listen, listen, listen. Then ask questions to increase your understanding.</p>
<p>• Eat something delicious. One exquisite bite is better than a feast of junk food.</p>
<p>• Embrace setbacks. How well you handle them defines your success.</p>
<p>• Like yourself. Because if you don&#8217;t, it&#8217;s unlikely anybody else will either.</p>
<p>• Meditate or pray. They reduce stress, the source of most illnesses.</p>
<p>• Plan for success. Refine your one, five and ten-year goals every three months.</p>
<p>• Do it now. The world changes so fast that if you wait it will be too late.</p>
<p>• Keep in touch. Friends are far, far more important than money.</p>
<p>• Take a walk. It clears your head and brings perspective.</p>
<p>• Breathe deeply. Living in the moment is the meaning of life.</p>
<p>• Choose positive thoughts. Negative thoughts can and will poison your life.</p>
<p>• Take vitamins. The lack of them is a bottleneck to sustainable health.</p>
<p>• Commit. Replace &#8220;I wish&#8221;, &#8220;I should&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;ll try&#8221; with &#8220;I will&#8221; or &#8220;I must.&#8221;</p>
<p>• Enjoy the moment. The pursuit of happiness is the source of unhappiness.</p>
<p>• Leave a light footprint. What we do to the earth we do to ourselves.</p>
<p>If these rules make sense, here&#8217;s a suggestion. Print the list and tape a copy on your bathroom mirror, on your refrigerator and beside your bed. Don&#8217;t wash your hands, get something to eat or go to sleep without reading at least one rule aloud.</p>

		<title>Why don’t All Medical Aid Schemes Pay for Preventative Screening Tests?</title>

<p>We all know that the good things in life are not for free.  And certainly, there are no free lunches in this day and age.</p>
<p>And so it is with medical aid schemes.  Every claim lodged by a member is reimbursed from the contributions paid by all members of the scheme.  The question often asked is why does the medical aid not pay for cleaning of teeth, pap smears, prostate exams, mammograms and other preventative benefits.</p>
<p>The answer is simple, but not favoured.  Members can have almost any healthcare benefit they want.  But &#8211; they will have to pay for it themselves by way of higher contributions.  Higher contributions often cause some members to question the value add that they get and if unaffordable or not worth it, they resign, or move to another medical aid scheme.  When such healthy members resign, they leave behind the less healthy, higher claiming members that must then finance their own health needs without any cross-subsidisation.</p>
<p>Mammograms are expensive and so every female member over, say 40, will have an exam.  This means that all members under 40 and particularly male members will be subsidising female members over 40.  They may think this unfair and resign.</p>
<p>Most medical aid schemes have a simple philosophy – their benefits are designed to provide funding for catastrophic events – accidents, illness and disease.</p>
<p>The counter argument is that if the medical aid scheme paid for preventative medicines and tests, then the catastrophes could be avoided.  Such an argument is certainly compelling, except for the fact that there is nothing to stop a member from using the preventative benefits from his/her scheme and then moving, in a very healthy state, to another medical scheme.</p>
<p>The Medical Schemes Act does not promote member loyalty.  Under the old Act members could receive no-claim bonuses or contribution loading to reward good health or punish bad risk.  The current Act however has none of that as all members must be treated equally.</p>
<p>Members of medical aid schemes therefore have a choice.  Because the majority of schemes are  focussed on the “big ticket” items (e.g. hospital plan benefits), members looking for cover for the out of hospital, preventative benefits , must self-insure that portion of the risk.  By doing this, their respective schemes are able to keep the cost of insuring the major catastrophic events as low as possible.  This principle is not new, as short-term insurance companies do it all the time.  When insuring a car, you can choose to pay a high premium and have no excess or, you can choose a lower premium but then you will have to cover the excess – the first portion of a claim up to a pre-determined amount.  The bigger the excess or portion that you carry – the lower the monthly premium will be and, of course, vice versa.</p>

		<title>Should Individuals Be Sent Home At The First Sign Of A Flu Or cold?</title>

<p>Flu spreads easily from person to person through droplet distribution when an infected person sneezes, coughs, or quite commonly, through hand-to-hand (physical) contact. In an office environment, where people are in close contact with each other, it is therefore more likely for the flu or cold virus to spread and infect other people too.</p>
<p>Office environments have many so-called “flu hot spots”, such as an elevator button, stair railing, bathroom door, photo copy machine, a kettle or fridge, to name but a few, that people can touch and come into contact with a virus.  According to virologists, epidemiologists and other experts, there is a correlation between being sick with a cold or the flu and making others sick by touching them directly, or handling an object that they may soon touch themselves.</p>
<p>In the workplace, this correlation has important implications which are related to the ethical principle of fairness.  Firstly, employees cannot meet the needs of clients if they are not feeling well and secondly, sick employees may pass their flu or cold on to co-employees, who in turn may pass it on to their families.</p>
<p>Presenteeism, which is when employees go into the office when sick but not fully functioning, may also present a bigger problem than employees missing work due to illness.  Personal productivity can be less than half of their usual level when employees show up for work sick.</p>
<p>Despite compelling reasons why we think we think we ought to go to work while we’re sick with a cold or flu, we shouldn’t.  Employees with flu symptoms such as a sore throat, a cough or body aches combined with a fever of 37.8 degrees Celcius or greater, should notify their managers that they are sick and stay at home.  Minimising contact with fellow employees until a fever is gone for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medication is important.</p>
<p>The best way to recover from a flu or cold and not spread it others, comes right from your grandmother’s book of sound advice:  stay in bed, get plenty of rest, drink enough fluids, gargle with salt water and give your body time to fight the infection. Stress and a lot of physical activity can depress our immune systems; hence the importance of rest.  If you don’t get better, go and see your doctor, whether you are on a full cover medical aid scheme, or just a hospital plan.</p>

<p>As employers, the best thing to do, is to send sick employees home.  It is important for companies to create a workplace environment where calling in sick isn’t frowned upon.  Employers owe a common law duty of care towards their employees and in the context of health, they have a duty to maintain a safe work environment for all employees.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that South African qualified medical practitioners receive some of the best medical training available and are generally highly regarded anywhere in the world. In addition to their superior academic training, South African doctors are faced with what has been described as a ‘quadruple burden of disease’, which includes a wide range of communicable (infectious) diseases, a rapidly growing incidence of chronic diseases of lifestyle, a high incidence of trauma and a wide range of maternal and perinatal conditions associated with pregnancy and confinement.</p>
<p>This all provides our GPs with a vast amount of training and experience which in turn equips them more than adequately to deal with such things on a regular basis.</p>
<p>So when people fall ill and require the services of a doctor in the private sector, where do South Africans turn and what determines that choice?</p>
<p>Sadly, the tendency is more and more towards members self-referring directly to a specialist.</p>
<p>We are, of course, extremely fortunate in our country to have superbly trained specialists across the entire spectrum of specialist disciplines and they are obviously experts in their particular field of practice, whereas the GP is required to have an overall but perhaps less detailed knowledge across all disciplines of medicine.</p>
<p>In choosing where to seek care, the real question should surely be related to the level of expertise required for the care that is sought. In other words, specialists should be seen as delivering a service to patients only when requested to do so by a GP, who has decided, together with the patient, that a greater expertise than s/he has, is required for the management and treatment of a specific illness or condition.</p>
<p>So why is it that patients in our country will often choose not to consult with their trusted GP for things that are often as routine as the monitoring of their blood pressure or diabetes or asthma? Why are the services of a gynaecologist sought for routine issues such as contraception or annual check-ups? Why do children need to see a paediatrician for routine illnesses and conditions?</p>

<p>The ‘old-fashioned’ approach of building a sound relationship with a general practitioner has enormous benefits, the most important being the critically important coordination of one’s overall healthcare. This has the effect of not only building trust, but also of impacting on the future affordability of healthcare which is under severe threat, not only in South Africa, but internationally.</p>
<p>There is a suggestion that any service capable of being delivered by a GP, but where the services of a specialist are used, ends up costing approximately 30% more. This should not be seen as suggesting that specialists are in any way over-charging for their services, but is merely mentioned in the context of highlighting the need to carefully spend every health rand wisely so that we are able to better manage the cost of <a href="https://www.genesismedical.co.za">medical aids in South Africa</a>, as well as the current levels of medical inflation that have out-stripped CPI by an average of 3% per annum for the last 10 – 15 years. This would, in turn, have a positive influence on annual increases in medical scheme contribution rates and make the funding of healthcare more affordable.</p>
<p>In summary, there are many reasons why this scenario of self-referral has evolved, but perhaps the time has come for South African GP&#8217;s to reclaim their rightful role in the system and for patients to be encouraged to first seek medical attention at an appropriate level of care.</p>

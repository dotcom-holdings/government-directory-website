<p>The country remained in the top position for the second year running with a score of 93 out of 100, supported by strong financial market infrastructure and a robust legal framework.</p>
<p>Despite this, the report warns that SA’s macroeconomic performance deteriorated in the past year as it plunged into recession for the first time since the global financial crisis, exposing SA to &#8220;rising financial risks&#8221;.</p>
<p>This could result in the country being challenged for the top spot by the likes of Kenya, Nigeria and Botswana</p>
<p>The index, produced by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, ranks the attractiveness of various financial markets for investors. It was compiled last week and officially launched on Wednesday.</p>
<p>It looks at market depth, access to foreign exchange, tax and regulatory environment and market transparency, capacity of local investors, macroeconomic opportunity, and enforceability of financial contracts, collateral positions and insolvency frameworks.</p>
<p>In 2017, SA topped the index on all fronts. But this year it is second to Kenya in access to foreign exchange and behind Nigeria in market transparency, tax and regulatory environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;SA’s open and highly liquid foreign exchange market has exposed it to capital outflows, reflecting concerns about the country’s macroeconomic trajectory,&#8221; says the report.</p>
<p>Of all the countries surveyed, SA is the only one where the total value of listed equities is more than $100bn, standing at $1.1-trillion. SA has more than $40bn worth of listed corporate bonds, compared with the average value of $707m for the other 19 countries, and a bond turnover of almost 300% of market capitalisation compared with the average value of the other countries of 20%.</p>
<p>According to the report, SA and countries such as Ghana and Kenya are lowering barriers to entry for small firms. It says capital markets in Africa have strengthened against a more stable regional political and economic background.</p>

<p>Mozambique and Namibia announced they were immediately suspending imports of the products. Botswana said it was recalling the items &#8220;with immediate effect&#8221;, while Zambia called on South African retail chains in its country to pull the incriminated goods from local shelves.</p>
<p>Since January 2017, 948 people in South Africa have contracted listeriosis &#8211; a disease caused by bacteria from soil, water, vegetation and animal faeces which can contaminate fresh food, notably meat.</p>
<p>At least 180 have died, according to official figures.</p>
<p>Health officials say the source of the outbreak was an Enterprise Food plant, 300km northeast of the South African capital of Pretoria.</p>
<p>Queues formed outside Enterprise sites in South Africa as angry consumers and small retailers gathered to demand refunds on their purchases of ready-to-eat meat products that include polony -a local version of baloney sausage &#8211; sliced ham and Frankfurter-style sausages.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve eaten already some polony and Russian (sausage). I don&#8217;t know, maybe I can get some disease,&#8221; said taxi driver Bongani Mavuso as he queued outside Enterprise&#8217;s factory shop in Germiston, Johannesburg to seek a refund. &#8220;I&#8217;m just coming to collect my money.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Sunday, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi took the unprecedented step of advising South Africans to avoid eating all processed meat products sold as &#8220;ready to eat&#8221; after announcing Enterprise as the outbreak&#8217;s source.</p>
<p>The Department of Health ordered retailers to immediately recall affected products.</p>
<p>The chief executive of Tiger Brands, which owns Enterprise, denied that its products had been shown to be responsible for the deaths.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no direct link with the deaths to our products,&#8221; Lawrence MacDougall told a news conference.</p>
<p>&#8216;Devastating&#8217; to be linked to outbreak </p>
<p>MacDougall did acknowledge that the government had linked the ST6 strain of listeria bacteria detected in Enterprise facilities with the outbreak that has resulted in 180 deaths.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are being extra cautious and vigilant, we are recalling all products made from the two facilities affected,&#8221; he said, adding that the government had only ordered the company to withdraw three product lines.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any loss of life is tragic. It is devastating for me to have our products linked to this outbreak.&#8221;</p>
<p>Enterprise-branded products accounted for 28.2 percent of processed meat sales in South Africa in 2017. The local market was worth 6.02 billion rand ($500 million) last year alone.</p>
<p>Tiger Brands, one of South Africa&#8217;s food giants, made pre-tax profits of 4.27 billion rands ($360 million) in 2017.</p>
<p>South Africa&#8217;s two largest supermarket operators, Shoprite and Pick n Pay, have also pulled products made by Rainbow Chickens after Motsoaledi confirmed that listeria had been identified in samples taken from one of its facilities.</p>
<p>Additional precautionary measure</p>
<p>Motsoaledi said on Sunday that Enterprise and Rainbow Chicken&#8217;s registration to export their products outside of South Africa had been temporarily suspended. Namibia also said it was suspending imports from Rainbow Chickens.</p>

<p>As fears of listeria continued to rise in South Africa, several other smaller food retailers have also announced product recalls.</p>
<p>High-end food chain Woolworths announced it was recalling dozens of sausage and ham products &#8220;as an additional precautionary measure&#8221;.</p>
<p>Zambia&#8217;s High Commissioner to Pretoria Emmanuel Mwamba called on South African supermarket chains operating in his country to also recall ready-to-eat meat as a precaution.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chain stores should emulate measures put in place by the South African government,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Mozambique Agriculture Ministry spokeswoman Florencia Cipriano told reporters on Monday that officials were working with importers to halt the flow of South African chilled meat products.</p>
<p>The United Nations has previously said South Africa&#8217;s listeriosis outbreak is believed to be the largest-ever worldwide.</p>
<p>The infection mainly affects children and has a three-week incubation period, making it difficult to track.</p>
<p>Contamination in humans &#8211; especially those with compromised immune systems &#8211; can result in flu-like illness, infection of the bloodstream and, in severe cases, infection of the brain which can prove fatal.</p>

<p>Chinese government officials have hinted that oil companies from the Asian country could purchase more African oil downstream operations, this follows China Petroleum &#38; Chemical Corporation’s (Sinopec) purchase last month of a controlling stake in Chevron’s southern African subsidiary, Caltex.</p>
<p>Sinopec paid $900m for Chevron equity in the Chevron South Africa (CSA) refinery in Cape Town, oil storage facilities, a lubricants factory in Durban and the Caltex service station distribution network across South Africa and Botswana. It had been reported that other companies were interested in buying the assets, including oil trader Glencore and French oil giant Total but they dropped out of the bidding. The government’s Central Energy Fund also made an offer for Caltex last year.</p>
<p>Under the deal, Sinopec has bought 100% of Chevron Botswana and 75% of Chevron South Africa, while the remaining 25% will be held by South African black empowerment investors, as required under South African law, plus an employee trust. The refinery, which will be Sinopec’s first in Africa, has production capacity of 100,000 b/d, while Caltex owns and operates 820 service stations.</p>
<p>In a statement, Sinopec revealed: “The SPA has already been filed with the Chinese government and remains subject to regulatory approvals in South Africa and Botswana. With a growing middle class, demand for refined petroleum in South Africa, the largest country in the region, has been increasing at an average annual rate of nearly 5% during the last five years, currently reaching a total of approximately 27m tonnes.” Aside from the fuel sales, the company will benefit from 220 retail outlets attached to service stations.</p>
Refining challenges
<p>Sinopec said that it intends to maintain the company’s existing operations and workforce, while upgrading its assets across the region. It then plans to start rebranding the retail network in five or six years’ time. This upgrade will presumably involve the modernisation and expansion of the Cape Town refinery. Cleaner fuel standards are being introduced in South Africa, which will require improvements in the nation’s refining capacity.</p>
<p>The new standards were supposed to have been introduced this July but the refining industry and government have been in dispute over how the refinery upgrades should be funded. This dispute may have precipitated Chevron’s withdrawal from the country; the US firm put the business up for sale in 2014. South Africa has five other refineries with combined production capacity of 600,000 b/d, including the two synthetic fuel plants at Mossel Bay and Secunda, which used natural gas and coal as feedstock respectively.</p>
<p>In 2012, Sinopec had signed an agreement with South African national oil company PetroSA to help develop a new refinery at Coega with production capacity of 360,000 b/d but the project has been postponed because of rising costs and economic problems in South Africa.</p>
<p>A spokesperson said: “With this investment, Sinopec looks forward to becoming an integral part of South Africa and Botswana’s local economies.” He added that the company would seek to contribute to “the development of the indigenous oil industry”, which could suggest that it is also interested in [...]]]></description>

<h3>Chinese investment in context</h3>
<p>China has experienced a very rapid rise in demand for fuel over the past 30 years but this has now slowed considerably. If Chinese companies want to keep growing then they have to secure access to more customers. Beijing has suggested that Africa offers the best source of fast fuel demand growth.</p>
<p>Although <a href="http://africanbusinessmagazine.com/south-africa/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">South Africa</a> and Botswana are relatively mature markets by African standards, the new Sinopec operations could be used as a starting point to expand into the rest of the continent. Sinopec now has downstream operations in six countries and is the third biggest fuel distributor in the world.</p>
<p>This is a new area of investment for Chinese companies in Africa and perhaps even more important than it may seem at first sight. Most Chinese investment in the continent in the past has been either aimed directly at securing access to raw materials; at infrastructure projects, with the aim of helping gain access to raw materials; and now more recently at the beginnings of manufacturing outsourcing. The Chevron-Sinopec deal seems purely motivated by commercial considerations and increasing market share.</p>

The BDP has been in power since 1966.</p>
<p>According to eNCA, four parties &#8211; the Botswana National Front, the Botswana Movement for Democracy, the Botswana Congress Party, and the Botswana People&#8217;s Party – came together as &#8220;a response to a plea by the people for the opposition to stop splitting votes and work together&#8221;.</p>
<p>The BDP&#8217;s popularity has reportedly been sinking since the 2014 elections due to a &#8220;sluggish economic growth and high youth unemployment&#8221;, the report said. &#8220;With only one opposition party in place now, I believe that the BDP will have to work very hard in the coming years to preserve or better its supremacy at the 2019 elections,&#8221; political analyst Anthony Morima was quoted as saying. Khama won a second term in 2014 after his party secured a parliamentary majority at the polls.</p>
<p>The BDP garnered at least 29 of the 57 parliamentary seats. The party, however, faced a challenge in urban areas, where opposition parties made inroads since the formation in 2010 of a breakaway party, the Botswana Movement for Democracy (BMD)</p>

<p>Chief Executive Officer of Botswana Innovation Hub (BIH), Alan Boshwaen, believes that the 5th edition of the IPA awards which brought together innovators from across Africa at the Gaborone International Convention Centre last year, was an eye opener for local innovators.</p>
<p>While he acknowledges that a prize would have been a morale booster for the locals, Boshwaen believes that the opportunity to host the continental event was, on its own, a window into the innovation space.</p>
<p>Other positives drawn from hosting the event, Boshwaen says, included seeing people who otherwise would not have seen themselves as innovators, stepping forward and enquiring on how they can link in and create innovations.</p>
<p>About 15 innovators submitted their work for the IPA in the areas of ICT, clean technology, mining and others but only two of them made it to the end stages. Others were shortlisted but they did not make it to the top 10.</p>
<p>The park, Boshwaen says, will be a crucial part of BIH services offering a one-stop-shop for innovation including top-end facilities, video conferencing, partnership, incubation and others.</p>
The Innovation Prize for Africa offers major cash prizes for those that come forward with genuinely ground-breaking innovations
<p>It offers annual Awards of US$ 185 000 to three winners and 7 nominees– capital that is now seeing amazing impacts on the winners who go on to attract more funds and create successful businesses.</p>
<p>The IPA also provides unique platforms for African innovators and innovation enablers to network, share knowledge, and discuss potential collaborations.</p>
<p>In addition selected innovators receive support and training in areas including communications, intellectual property and business development.</p>

<p>This was said by Botswana Tourism Organization (BTO)&#8217;s tourism development manager, Ms Bigani Sethume on December 30 in Maun.</p>
<p>She said this development would improve the local economy as hotels received high numbers of bookings. Tourists also spend their money on local products, a move that improves the local people&#8217;s lives, Ms Sethume said in an interview.</p>
She attributed this growth partly to the fact that government, through BTO, was aggressively marketing the tourism product locally and internationally
<p>We will continue to sell this country as a tourism destination of choice, stated Ms Sethume.</p>
<p>Also, she explained that the region saw an increase in tourism because of its beauty and abundant flora and fauna.</p>
<p>Ms Sethume was also happy that Batswana were starting to realise that the country has a good tourism product, which was at par with that of other countries with oceans and beautiful coastlines.</p>

		<title>BOTSWANA STILL BETTING ON ITS DIAMONDS</title>

<p>The partnership between De Beers and Botswana has undergone major changes recently due to the 2011 renewal of the sales agreement between Debswana Diamond Company and De Beers.</p>
<p>The 2011 deal saw De Beers move its global sightholder sales division from London to Gaborone, meaning that 90% of its diamonds are now sold from there, including stones from South Africa, Namibia and Canada.</p>
<p>De Beers sells most of its diamonds to between 70 and 80 so-called sightholders – pre-approved buyers with long-term off-take agreements.</p>
<p>De Beers CEO Bruce Cleaver said: “They all have different kinds of businesses. Some can deal with big diamonds, some can deal with different shapes and colours, and so on.”</p>
Instead of going to London, these companies now send 150 to 200 people to Gaborone 10 times a year for sights that last for up to a week
<p>Another development from the 2011 deal was the creation of the state-owned Okavango Diamond Company, which is essentially a small version of global sightholder sales division that gets to sell 15% of Debswana.</p>
<p>This complements the 15% stake Botswana has in the overall De Beers group.</p>
<p>Botswana has also drawn in a number of cutting and polishing operations. Before 2008, there were two in the country, and now there are 20.</p>
<p>Mineral revenues amount to about a third of Botswana’s national budget, but can fluctuate wildly.</p>
In this year’s budget, mineral revenue was projected at 17 billion pula (R22 billion) compared with 19 billion pula last year and 15 billion pula the year before
<p>Debswana, De Beers’ mining entity in Botswana, is owned 50-50 with the government. The government, however, gets 80% of its mining profits due to royalties. Those profits derive from selling 85% of Debswana diamonds to De Beers’ sales arm.</p>
<p>The other 15% of Debswana’s diamonds gets sold to the Okavango Diamond Company.</p>
<p>This new part of the partnership gives the government 15% of the trading profits, which previously all went to De Beers.</p>

<p>The programme, which is funded by European Union, has rolled out to Khonkhwa, Mahotshwane, Keng, Khakhea, Morwamosu, Itholoke, Mabutsane, Kutuku and Sekoma.</p>
<p>It is mandated to empower women economically where they are organised in small groups and they decide on how they want to raise funds for themselves and alternatively do monthly or weekly contributions towards the group.</p>
<p>The leader of the group named Sedibeng Go Iwa Ka Tsela, Dyna Batshomi is one proud lady who has not allowed poverty to depress her.</p>
<p>She and other nine members are working tirelessly to support each other socially, financially and business-wise. The group meets every Tuesday to reflect on the challenges they face daily and see how they can help each other.</p>
The group has opened a bank account from which they loan each other some funds to start small businesses
<p>They also do motshelo of cutlery as a way of encouraging each other to have kitchen utensils. Batshomi glorified the GROW programme which she said has empowered them to form groups of empowerment that has further opened their eyes to care for each other.</p>
<p>Though they have fundraising activities to help their group grow, each member also has a small business like a bakery, tuck shop and kiosk to sustain their family.</p>
It is also initiatives like these which unite a small close-knit community like Khonkhwa, which is not endowed with the kind of developments found in bigger villages
<p>Batshomi also added that they assist each other with small insurance covers of burial and other celebrations, which require contributions.</p>
<p>“We are however strict when it comes to attendance and punctuality in our meetings, hence we charge the offenders a certain amount to add to our account.</p>
<p>We also depend on joining fees and other contributions to keep our account active,” she explained.</p>
Another resident who is a member of Sa-Mosima group is also grateful for the empowerment groups in her village
<p>Oikanye Baitiredi has been sitting at home wondering where the next meal will come from but thanks to the GROW programme, she borrowed money from her group to start a pop-corn business.</p>
<p>She is known among the residents for knocking door-to-door to sell her home made popcorns. Though she said she needs a popcorn making machine, she is determined to supply and satisfy her customers who are mostly the elderly as well as primary school pupils.</p>
<p>There is light at the end of the tunnel for these women who wake up everyday to eke out a living against challenges of being perhaps far from social amenities.</p>

<p>“One of the things we are dealing with is captured democracies that don&#8217;t work for the poor‚ that don&#8217;t work for people in countries that are underdeveloped‚ where people are made to be rubber stampers of decisions that are made elsewhere. We wanted someone who is going to interrogate that‚” he explained.</p>
<p>The address will be one of Obama&#8217;s most high-profile speeches since leaving office. He is also expected to stimulate reflection.</p>
<p>Obama’s foreign policy has been heavily criticised while locally‚ Mandela’s legacy has been questioned over “settling” for political power while &#8220;failing” to shift economic power to the people.</p>
<p>“Obama is not a perfect leader‚ he doesn&#8217;t have a perfect legacy‚ in fact his own legacy is as contested as that of Madiba. People question what he did‚ the decisions he took‚ and we are a platform that gives people the opportunity to interrogate these legacies‚ not people who are going to gloss over issues. That is why we wanted him to come here‚” Koti said.</p>
<p>However‚ Koti said it was important for the foundation to bring a person who was not only inspired by Madiba’s legacy personally but who had also modelled their own leadership after Madiba.</p>
<p>“Like Madiba‚ he is inspired by the issue of future leaders‚ emerging leadership‚ young people‚” he added.</p>
<p>Hence‚ during his visit‚ Obama will launch his foundation&#8217;s leadership programme‚ which is made up of 200 young Africans chosen from nearly 10‚000 applications from 44 countries across the continent.</p>
<p>Previous speakers include former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan‚ former Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf‚ former South African president Thabo Mbeki‚ Archbishop Desmond Tutu and former Irish president and philanthropist Mary Robinson.</p>
<p>The lecture will take place at Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg and is expected to be attended by 15‚000 people.</p>

<p>New housing MMC Meshack van Wyk said in the coming 2018/19 financial year, the City aimed to release some 3 500 title deeds. This, he said, would empower the poorest residents, who would be able to give their families the security of permanent tenure.</p>
<p>“It is estimated that some 30 000 accommodation units are required in the short term to address the needs of the most vulnerable households.”</p>
<p>Van Wyk explained that, therefore, the current administration wants to speed up the delivery of title deeds. The City has, over the last two years, delivered more than 5 000 title deeds across Joburg.</p>

<p>Power of Women, Inspiration Night and Celebration of our Future are some of the themes that will define the celebration of the music forms loved in the township. The last one is particularly relevant, says organiser Nolan Baynes of International Arts Solutions, because the festival coincides with Youth Day.</p>
<p>As a result, the programme is fresh and genre-blurring. Visitors will be jamming along to local artists, including Lady Zamar, who took the gong for best dance album at the SA Music Awards last week, gospel star Khaya Mthethwa, Mi Casa, rapper Nasty C, soul star Zamajobe, jazzy R&#38;B king Ernie Smith and the Soweto Gospel Choir.</p>
<p>“We want young people to see themselves represented. We want people who can afford to buy a ticket and to support local vendors to generate revenue in Soweto,” said Baynes, adding that there would be significant free tickets and discounted tickets for Soweto residents.</p>
<p>But the festival is aimed at the entire city – the entire planet, in fact. International Night will also feature a multigenre line-up, among them Grammy winners, including Deborah Cox, Third World, Bob James, Spyro Gyra, The Neville Brothers and, in his first performance in South Africa, R&#38;B legend Charlie Wilson.</p>
<p>“We love jazz, but the economic reality of a purely jazz line-up is limited in scope. We are attempting to duplicate the New Orleans Jazz Fest, Newport Jazz Fest or Montreal Jazz Fest models,” said Baynes.</p>
<p>After attending an event at the Soweto Theatre last year, his plan to host a jazz fest became an imperative. His ultimate goal is “to have Pan-African, American and European music fans descending on Soweto”.</p>
<p>But, ultimately, Baynes told City Press, the dream is to present a festival that highlights the diverse and rich spirit of Soweto.</p>
<p>The event runs from 14 to 17 June at the Soweto Theatre. Tickets are available from sowetotheatre.com, Webtickets and
Pick n Pay outlets.</p>

Gauteng Premier David Makhura (Madelene Cronje/MG)
<p>Gauteng Premier David Makhura has placed his hopes on the advent of the fourth industrial revolution to provide solutions for the province’s youth unemployment crisis.</p>
<p>Makhura delivered his state of the province address at the Gauteng legislature on Monday where he said nearly 2-million young people in the province were unemployed, not in schooling or receiving any sort of training.</p>
<p>The interventions proposed by the province appeared heavily centred on taking advantage of the digital economy to create employment opportunities.</p>
<p>“As part of addressing structural youth unemployment we are aligning our education and training to meet the needs of our new economy,” Makhura said.</p>
<p>“We have a partnership with technology companies to train young people in digital skills so they can take full advantage of employment and entrepreneurship opportunities in the digital economy,” he added.</p>
<p>Makhura said the focus on tech and digital skills had already been started from a basic education level, where he said the province was the leader in digital skills training nationally</p>
<p>He also announced plans to improve the effectiveness of the Gauteng Innovation Hub, through collaborations with technology entrepreneurs who would mentor young tech entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>“This year we will sent 20 tech-preneurs to Silicon Valley where they will join the rest of the world so that we too can be at the forefront of the digital revolution,” Makhura said.</p>
<p>To date Gauteng government’s flagship Tshepo 1-million programme has benefited more than 460 000 young people since its inception in 2015.</p>
<p>The programme, which is a joint project between the public and private sectors, aims to empower 1 million young people through skills training and job placement and entrepreneurship development.</p>

<p>Durbanites eat the least sugar and salt while Cape Town and Johannesburg residents are better at stocking up on fruit and vegetables.</p>
<p>This is among the findings of the Discovery Vitality ObeCity Index 2017‚ released on Wednesday‚ which presents the latest insights on weight status as measured by Body Mass Index and waist circumference and food purchasing behaviour of nearly half a million Vitality members in Johannesburg‚ Pretoria‚ Cape Town‚ Durban‚ Bloemfontein and Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Cape Town scores best with 53.5% of Capetonians having a normal weight status.</p>
<p>Johannesburg and Durban came in at second and third with 52% and 51.8%‚ respectively.</p>
<p>Port Elizabeth and Bloemfontein have the worst weight status‚ with 48.8% of residents having a healthy weight status in both cities.</p>
<p>&#8220;While there are some positive trends‚ we still have a lot to do to combat obesity‚&#8221; the index&#8217;s authors said in a statement‚ noting the increased risk of heart disease‚ type 2 diabetes‚ certain cancers and premature death.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our data shows that being obese increases healthcare costs by as much as R4‚400 per person per year.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s no surprise that we find ourselves in this situation as our eating habits have changed for the worse in recent decades. In fact‚ statistics show that South Africans now spend more money on beer than on vegetables and fruit combined. We are increasingly foregoing whole‚ fresh foods in favour of energy-dense processed foods and sugary soft drinks. This is compounded by the fact that we’re exercising less with more sedentary lifestyles.&#8221;</p>
<p>In South Africa‚ sales of ready-made meals‚ snack bars and instant noodles increased by 40% between 2005 and 2010‚ Vitality said‚ adding fast food consumption continues to grow‚ negatively impacting our weight.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a long way to go to reach a healthy weight status as a nation. South Africans in general consume insufficient portions of vegetables and fruit and too much sugar and salt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cape Town purchased the most portions of fruit and vegetables compared to other cities‚ followed by Johannesburg and Bloemfontein. Port Elizabeth and Durban purchased the least portions of fruit and vegetables.</p>
<p>Durban purchased 34% less fruit and vegetables compared to Cape Town‚ the winning city.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see a positive relationship between weight status and fruit and vegetable purchasing‚&#8221; said Discovery.</p>
<p>South Africans overall are eating only three servings of fruit and veg (230g) a day instead of the recommended five servings (400g)‚ the index stated.</p>
<p>Durbanites purchased the least amount of salt compared to other cities‚ with second and third place being held by residents in Port Elizabeth and Pretoria‚ respectively. Johannesburg and Cape Town purchased the most amount of salt.

<p>Commenting on the index‚ Discovery said its data shows that members who purchase healthy foods have a 10% lower BMI compared to those who purchase unhealthy foods. It states the same purchasing behaviour is associated with up to R2‚500 lower health costs per year.</p>
<p>Its advice is simple &#8211; cook at home at least five times a week.</p>
<p>&#8220;Studies show that homemade meals typically contain more vegetables and less fat than any other meal. People who cook at home are almost certain to consume fewer kilojoules‚ more variety‚ adequate nutrients and fewer processed foods.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition: &#8220;Home-cooked meals allow for appropriate portion sizes‚ while restaurant portions are known to be unnecessarily large. This contributes to the overeating culture and the global obesity issue&#8221;.</p>

 It is not a human health problem but an animal one

<p>According to the interim CEO of the South African Poultry Association‚ the outbreak only affects birds and not the health of human beings.</p>
<p>“It would be misleading and could have a negative impact on the industry if we cause a scare. It’s important for people to know that this does not affect their health but that of birds &#8211; wild birds in this case. This is not a crisis but just another outbreak. We are treating it on a cautionary level‚” Charlotte Nkuna said.</p>
<p>Senior agricultural economist at Absa Wessel Lemmer said that consumers should not be worried about this outbreak.</p>
<p>“Consumers are concerned but it is important to know that this strain does not affect human beings. Poultry producers are vigilant and monitor poultry breading‚ rearing‚ broiler production and egg-laying units closely.</p>
<p>“Note that our poultry producers in South Africa already took on additional biosecurity measures to protect the future production of broilers and eggs. It is also comforting to know that South Africa’s veterinary sector rates among the best in the world. ” said Lemmer.</p>
<p>Johannesburg City Parks and Zoo (JPCZ) echoed Nkuna and Lemmer by saying the H5N8 strain prevalent in Johannesburg is not contagious to human beings.</p>

 All birds are susceptible to the infection

<p>City Parks spokesperson Jenny Moodley says that all birds are in danger of contracting the flu.</p>
<p>“We picked it up from two blue crane birds that we found dead at one of the affected areas. One bird was 18 and the other 27 years old. We then did tests and they came positive. This was in August. Since then we started getting reports that the Westdene dam had affected carcasses. All birds are prone to getting the infection.</p>
<p>“We appeal with pet owners to keep their birds enclosed. They need to monitor the animals and ensure that they are not in contact with other birds from outside because you will never know which one is affected. Also‚ sometimes you find that one of the birds is infected and this might easily spread to the others. At the moment we have not yet culled any wild or domestic birds‚” Moodley said.</p>
<p>Symptoms in birds include a combination of respiratory problems‚ or diarrhoea followed by rapid death. All dead birds are being incinerated and are being handled as per strict health and safety regulations.</p>

 Precautionary measures to take

<p>City Parks urges the public to refrain from handling or making contact with sick or dead birds.</p>
<p>“Do not attempt to feed wild birds or resuscitate sick birds. Do not attempt to feed sick birds. Report sightings of sick or dead birds to JCPZ on 011-712-6600. A team is on standby to assist with the removal of diseased birds which are being incinerated‚” Moodley said in a statement.</p>
<p>People are encouraged to ensure that all poultry produce is properly cooked before consumption. Residents who have [...]]]></description>

<ol start="4">
<li><strong> Places under quarantine should be a no-go zone</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The interim CEO of South African Poultry Association warns that areas under quarantine should be controlled and every movement must be authorised and recorded to curb a further spread.</p>
<p>“If a place is under quarantine there should be no movement. Everything that goes in and out must be checked. Ideally it should be closed and no unauthorised movement must take place. Dealing with a public place is different. Chances are you can’t control what goes in and out so this might result in an increase on the out-spread‚” Nkuna said.</p>
<p>However‚ Joburg Zoo remains open to visitors. They will need to use footbaths with disinfectant at the exits. “Vehicles exiting from inside the Zoo are being sprayed as well and employees leaving the Zoo are also requested to comply with the daily quarantine measures put in place to contain the spread of the Avian Influenza‚” Moodley said in a statement.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> Affected areas</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In the statement‚ City Parks said that the contagious flu was evident in various parts of the country. In the city of Joburg it is concentrated around the Westdene Dam‚ Emmarentia Dam‚ Zoo Lake and the Joburg Zoo.</p>
<p>“At this stage we are monitoring all our water bodies in the city. We get reports and go do tests and in due diligence we are able to take precautionary measures. It’s difficult to say that there is an increase or decrease in the reports‚ sometimes we get many and sometimes there are less reports‚” Moodley told TimeLIVE.</p>
<p>Other outbreaks were detected and reported at Mpumalanga and the Western Cape in the past months.</p>

<p>“We wish to compliment the City of Tshwane for taking the bold decision yesterday to introduce A Re Yeng bus services in Mamelodi, even though the infrastructure is not in place,” Gauteng Roads and Transport MEC Ismail Vadi said at the launch held under the theme ‘Transforming and Modernising Public Transport in Gauteng’.</p>
<p>The operating company for A Re Yeng is wholly owned by the taxi industry in the region.</p>
<p>“This is a wonderful example of the municipality and the taxi industry going the proverbial ‘extra mile’ in service of our communities,” MEC Vadi said.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Provincial road network</p>
<p>The provincial department has a road network of 5 638km, with 4 250km being paved roads. The network includes 676 bridges and 428 culverts.</p>
<p>“We have been hard at work to maintain and upgrade this network. Yet, we are deeply disappointed by the damage that is being done to this network by overloaded freight vehicles and at times community protesters,” MEC Vadi said.</p>
<p>The total asset value of the network is calculated at R25.5 billion.</p>
<p>MEC Vadi condemned the damage caused last week to the R59 in Meyerton by service delivery protesters, who had dug a wide and deep trench right across the dual lane road, putting at risk the lives of motorists.</p>
<p>“The sad thing about what happened in Meyerton is that protesters threatened and intimidated departmental officials who were on site to repair the road.</p>
<p>“While we are mindful of the rights of residents to protest, this should be done within the confines of the law and without damage to public infrastructure,” he said.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Transport Month events</p>
<p>During Transport Month, the department will officially open new bus-rapid transit (BRT) routes in the Tshwane city centre and host a rail summit with PRASA to look at safety and service delivery standards, specifically along the Vereeniging-Johannesburg corridor.</p>
<p>A new technological application for travelling information and a pilot of the integrated e-ticket across Gautrain and BRT systems in the province will also be launched.</p>
<p>The rehabilitation of the Double-Decker, Oxford and Federation bridges has been completed and the three lanes on both sides of the M1 freeway will be opened to traffic shortly. </p>

Dembovsky said a company called Syntell, which contracts services to traffic authorities, has launched the campaign which it states is on behalf of the Road Traffic Infringement Agency (RTIA).</p>
<p>It seeks to “rake in monies applicable to stagnated traffic fines issued by the Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department”, said Dembovsky. “Syntell previously did similar with traffic fines issued by the Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Police Department in terms of the Criminal Procedure Act, against which a national directive… ordering the withdrawal of stagnated matters exists,” he said.</p>
<p>Infringements</p>
<p>The latest email campaign is sent from a “RTIA@trafficnotification.co.za” address, and contains recipients’ names, ID numbers, vehicle details, and a list of outstanding AARTO infringement notices.</p>
<p>“In numerous instances, the fines listed date back five years, to 2012, when the JMPD ceased unlawfully violating Section 30(1) of the AARTO Act by posting bogus AARTO infringement notices it had captured on its systems since April 2010 by ordinary domestic mail.”</p>
<p>Dembovsky said it appears the RTIA is waiting for alleged infringers to make written representations to it in order to have the stagnated fines withdrawn or cancelled. This is done with the “apparent hope that less-informed motorists will pay these stagnated fines”.</p>
<p>“It adopted the same tactic in the previous matter where the JMPD acted unlawfully – until the JMPD and the RTIA found themselves being threatened with litigation if they did not administratively cancel all of the outstanding unlawful fines the JMPD had issued,” said Dembovsky.</p>
<p>He said that most of the infringement notices referred to in the emails have stagnated, and the associated threats were extortive.</p>
<p>“The threat which repeatedly appears in these emails stating that you will not be able to renew your vehicle or driving licence whilst an enforcement order is outstanding is, while not patently untrue, not only extortive in nature, but is an empty threat since no enforcement order may be lawfully issued on an arbitrary basis.”</p>

<p>The carnival, which coincided with Heritage Day celebrations, saw people dressed in their traditional attire, fancy dress costumes, choir outfits and uniforms. They mingled with brass bands, drum majorettes and colourful floats measuring up to five meters in height as they paraded the streets of the capital city.</p>
<p>There was also a procession of stilt walkers and Samba dancers who gave carnival-goers a glimpse into the country’s rich and diverse cultures.</p>
<p>Several countries&#8217; embassies such China and Argentina also represented their cultures.</p>
<p>Held under the theme “Celebrating Our Living Heritage: Treasure, The Year of O.R. Tambo”, the carnival is an important vehicle which takes forward the provincial government’s commitment towards nation building and social cohesion, Premier David Makhura who led the celebrations said.</p>
<p>The premier said the province wants to grow the carnival to the size of the Rio carnival.</p>
<p>“Next year we want to attract over 50 000 participants. We want to make sure that schools in the province also become part of the carnival because when young people are involved the celebration will continue for coming generations,” said premier Makhura.</p>
<p>The carnival also created economic opportunities in both tourism and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>This year’s carnival created more than 3500 work opportunities and benefited 270 000 entrepreneurs who were providing services to the carnival.</p>
<p>The premier said the majority of those who benefited are township business.</p>
<p>“There is an economic impact, increase in tourism, and more entrepreneurs who emerge from such an occasion.”</p>
<p>The premier announced that the provincial government was considering introduction Swahili to schools in the province as more than half of the people in the continent speak it.</p>
<p>“People in the province must know all the 11 African languages. You must also know Swahili because this is Africa. We want to make sure in all our schools in Gauteng one of the things we introduce is Swahili … so that we can talk amongst ourselves.”</p>
<p>The premier also used his address to call for tolerance among the people of Gauteng.</p>
<p>“Let us unite as Africans. Let us make it easy for us to live together.”</p>
<p>Jovial citizens, especially those from other African countries, could not hide their excitement.</p>
<p>“Today is beautiful. We are eating from one plate … I don’t feel like a foreign national,” Orji Adoti told SAnews.</p>
<p>Poet Jessica Mbagana said that Heritage Day is an important reminder of black consciousness.</p>
<p>“Today is one of those days where we need to remind ourselves of who and what we are. We need to have conversations about us and our culture so that we can embrace our diversity to achieve socio-economic transformation.</p>
<p>The day will end with a festival of food, live cultural music, cultural dances and performances from different genres of DJ’s performing on four different stages at the Tshwane Events Centre.</p>

<p>Shoppers and visitors who want to use the new parking payment system can download an app or sign up to the Admyt system, which will require login credentials and credit card or debit card details.</p>
<p>The Admyt app is free and charges are the same as for normal paper tickets, or occasionally better &#8211; good deals are sometimes negotiated and are available for download on iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Once information is inputted, the shopper can simply drive up to the boom gate of his choice. Booms will open automatically through number plate recognition, by means of a camera at the boom gates. The same occurs on departure. The parking fee will be charged to the driver&#8217;s credit or debit card, and admit will send on the parking receipt afterwards.</p>
<p>The company behind the technology told Fin24 that all card details are securely stored using encryption technology.</p>
<p>Payment tokens are sent to parking management, with no one able to view the user’s information.  Preston Gaddy, general manager of the Sandton Precinct, said: “With the rise of technological innovation in the world, today’s public have come to know and appreciate technology for making almost everything in life a lot easier.&#8221;</p>
<p>Admyt recently launched similar parking options in shopping centres in Benmore Gardens, Rivonia Village and Cradlestone Mall.</p>

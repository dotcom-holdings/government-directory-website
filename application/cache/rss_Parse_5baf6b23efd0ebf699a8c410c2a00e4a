<p>It is especially puzzling since the latest REIPPP energy price bids that Eskom refuse to sign are so much lower than the first ones.</p>
<p>Abengoa, a Spanish renewable energy company, recently announced the completion of its latest concentrated solar power (CSP) plant, Xina Solar One.</p>
<p>According to a representative from the company, the project supplies clean electricity to 95,000 South African households. By means of Xina and two other plants the company built earlier, Kaxu Solar One and Khi Solar One, the company provides electricity to almost a million people in the Northern Cape.</p>
<p>These three projects have created 1,300 jobs during the construction phase, and now provide 80 permanent jobs during the operation and maintenance phase which will last for the next 25 years.</p>
<p>Significant local content, which also created jobs and brought economic benefit to the province, is said to be worth around R2.8 billion. It is understood that the renewable energy independent power producers’ procurement (REIPPP) programme as a whole has created approximately 15,000 jobs.</p>
<p>This excludes the hundreds of indirect support jobs in industries such as logistics, accommodation, and catering which were created throughout the development and construction of these projects.</p>
<p>Skills development</p>
<p>The skills development that the project, and others like it, brought to the Northern Cape was significant. The projects created specialist pipe welders and structure welders, pipe fitters, electricians, engineers, technicians, construction workers, and operators.</p>
<p>Several of these types of skills could not be sourced locally at the start of these projects – for example, there were no welders.</p>
<p>The first round of renewable energy projects developed these skills in the province. Today, there is a skilled pool of welders available for future projects or in other industries.</p>
<p>Socio-economic benefits</p>
<p>Clean energy development under the REIPPP programme has become integrally linked with socio-economic benefits for the communities near to where they are built. Not only is more than enough clean energy provided by these projects to support the entire province, but the whole community has benefitted as well.</p>
<p>The Xina project, as well as all the other IPP projects, is required to contribute 1.1% of the project’s capital expenditure on socio-economic development and enterprise development for the benefit of the communities who live within a 50km radius of the project.</p>
<p>Abengoa, for example, invested these funds in projects which were designed to meet the most pressing local needs, such as education, healthcare, social support, as well as small business and entrepreneur development.</p>
<p>Many renewable energy companies have developed programmes which offer bursaries, internships, the funding of additional teachers at local schools, the construction of additional classrooms, and general renovations of schools.</p>
<p>Social support included soup kitchens, food gardens, as well as other social programmes such as new housing developments, new medical and office equipment for a local clinic, and the building of an irrigation channel in Onseepkans.</p>

<p>Social support included soup kitchens, food gardens, as well as other social programmes such as new housing developments, new medical and office equipment for a local clinic, and the building of an irrigation channel in Onseepkans.</p>
<p><strong>Renewables support Eskom</strong></p>
<p>Renewable energy projects were built partly in response to the load-shedding and frequent power outages the country experienced from 2008.</p>
<p>It has given Eskom the time and space it needed to conduct the required maintenance on many of its coal-fired power stations, thereby supporting the utility and the national grid at a time of crisis.</p>
<p>It also now gives Eskom the opportunity to export surplus energy to South Africa’s neighbours at unregulated prices. Concurrent with the country’s energy crisis, South Africa is experiencing the worst drought on record since 1933.</p>
<p>South Africa is regarded as a water scarce region, and as the water crisis intensifies, it is imperative to pursue generation options which do not require the large amounts of water that coal-fired power stations do.</p>
<p>In Western Australia, for example, which is perceived as climatically similar to the Western Cape, the so-called “millennium drought” of the early 2000s caused policymakers to implement a fleet of desalination projects, which now supply a significant portion of the region’s water supply.</p>
<p>Similar water shortages in the Middle East and North Africa have resulted in these countries also successfully pursuing desalination.</p>
<p>Desalination requires a significant amount of electrical energy. If that electricity can be provided by the sun and the wind, the country would have clean water from clean energy sources.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these electricity generation plants can be built more quickly, more efficiently and less expensively than coal-fired or nuclear-powered generation.</p>
<p><strong>Gas-to-power</strong></p>
<p>South Africa is considering a gas-to-power programme to support a solar and wind fleet to address the variability of wind and solar power, by supplying power when the wind doesn’t blow or the sun doesn’t shine.</p>
<p>Gas-to-power plants can be ramped up or down very quickly to meet any differences in electricity demand and supply resulting from the variable output of wind and solar power generation plant. Although natural gas is a fossil fuel, it burns without emitting particulates and produces lower levels of harmful gases than the burning of coal.</p>
<p>It would also ensure that these companies participate in a framework which encourages economic empowerment for previously disadvantaged people (BEE-programme).</p>
<p><strong>Energy storage</strong></p>
<p>Interestingly, the Xina Solar One plant uses CSP technology, which is the only widespread renewable energy technology to include an integrated storage system.</p>
<p>This makes the technology more expensive, but enables the CSP plant to continue generating electricity during days of intermittent sunshine, and for six hours after sunset. This means the plant can contribute to meeting the evening demand peak.</p>
<p>In future, it is expected that energy storage technologies like molten salt, Li-ion batteries and others will become more common.</p>
<p><strong>An uncertain future with Eskom</strong></p>
<p>Eskom says it won’t sign new power producer agreements (PPAs) because the cost of electricity from independent power producers (IPPs) is too high.</p>
<p>However, if the power utility was to sign the newer PPAs, which offer more electricity at lower tariffs, it would benefit from a blended cost which would significantly reduce the overall cost of electricity.</p>

<p>Minister Shabangu made the call during the official launch of the 2017 Women’s Month held in Tshwane on Tuesday.</p>
<p>South Africa commemorates Women’s Month in August as a tribute to more than 20 000 women who marched to the Union Buildings on 9 August 1956 in protest against the extension of pass laws to women.  Minister Shabangu said working with men through strategic partnerships is necessary to transform society.</p>
<p>“Women … must feel free. Men must make sure that they work together with women, and also play a role in ensuring their safety,” Minister Shabangu said.  She said it is encouraging that some men have answered the call to work together to end violence on women.</p>
<p>“These men have launched campaigns that recognise that it is not enough for men to be silent when their sisters, cousins, partners, friends, wives, neighbours and mothers are violated and live in fear. This is testimony that there are good men who care.”  However, the Minister stressed the need to see and hear more men speaking out and acting against the abuse of women.</p>
<p>She also acknowledged various faith based organisations (FBOs), who have joined the fight for no violence against women and children. She called on other FBOs, including traditional leaders, community leaders and women’s organisations, to stand up against violence, drug abuse and other social ills, 365 days of the year.</p>
<p>“We believe that forging partnerships with communities, business, FBOs and traditional leadership will give women first hand opportunity to directly influence government programmes and ensure the mainstreaming of gender issues through the National Dialogues Programme,” said Minister Shabangu.</p>
<p>Dialogue Programme </p>
<p>The Women’s Month launch also marks the rolling out of the National Dialogue Programme. The department visits communities to have honest conversations about how women have internalised the roles that have been taught to them in their families, schools, by friends, in places of worship, and in the media.</p>
<p>The Minister said that the dialogues are also going to scrutinise the effects of how families “reserve the biggest piece of meat for men”.</p>
<p>“Our churches are led by men, the majority of schoolbooks are written by men, and the media is dominated by men. These realities contribute to how men are positioned as more important than women in society,” she said.</p>
<p>Not in my name </p>
<p>The chairperson of the organisation, Not In My Name SA, Siyabulela Jentile, called on men to take part in the fight against the scourge of violence against women.</p>
<p>“It’s not enough as South African men to say we are sorry to the women of South Africa, but we need to take corrective action towards making these programmes a success… We call on all men to come forward and join forces with us so that we can take collective responsibility and collective action to say ‘not in my name’.</p>

<p>CCBSA is introducing them to the possibilities of entrepreneurship through a concept dubbed Bizniz in a Box. This initiative gives young people between the ages of 24 and 35 and living in townships the opportunity, skills and funding to set up and run their own successful container shops.
From December last year to February this year, total revenue for the first six shops increased from just over R50 000 a month to more than R200 000, demonstrating the great potential of the programme.</p>
<p>Talented young people are selected, trained in marketing, sales, stock management and finance and given access to funding to start their container business – literally a business in a box.</p>
<p>“Aspiring entrepreneurs in SA face a number of challenges including a lack of funding and skills, fierce competition from bigger companies and regulatory challenges. These common hurdles have resulted in high failure rates for small businesses,” says Tsholofelo Mqhayi, head of enterprise and community development at CCBSA.</p>
<p>“Through the Bizniz in a Box process, we’re helping young people set up and manage thriving businesses in their communities.”</p>
<p>The programme grooms young entrepreneurs to run their own businesses through on-the-job training. This means they are assessed on their actual performance in a live environment, rather than in a classroom set-up only. It also gives candidates a taste of what it’s like to operate a micro business independently.</p>
<p>Once they’ve completed repayment of a portion of the capital cost of the store and met the performance criteria, the store is officially handed over to them and their new life as a fully independent entrepreneur begins.</p>
<p>They are also encouraged to start thinking about other opportunities outside their shop, such as opening up a franchised business.</p>

<p>The discovery of a gene that is a major cause of sudden death among under-35s is likely to put South Africa on the map in the world of genetics, showing that the country “is on par with international researchers”.</p>
<p>Maryam Fish, 30, of Lansdowne, led an all-female team of researchers at the University of Cape Town, along with Gasnat Shaboodien and Sarah Krause, who made the discovery with researchers from Italy.</p>
<p>The gene, called CDH2, is found in everyone, but a mutation causes a genetic disorder known as arrythmogenic right ventricle cardiomyopathy (ARVC), which increases the risk of heart disease and cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>Sudden cardiac death is estimated to hit more than five young people in South Africa daily, according to the Medical Research Council.</p>
<p>In under-35s an inherited form of disease of the heart muscle plays a prominent role in fatalities as a result of cardiac arrest.
“We sequenced all the genes in the human genome in two cousins who were affected,” said Fish, explaining that the cousins were identified after a 22-year-old relative died suddenly.</p>
<p>“We then looked for common variants and had a list of 13000, which we narrowed down through a series of filtering criteria until we got the CDH2 variant, which was the most likely causal variant in this family.”</p>
<p>The team then screened the gene in a number of unrelated individuals who also had ARVC.</p>
<p>This added “more evidence to our case that the CDH2 gene was the causal gene for ARVC”.</p>
<p>The soft-spoken PhD graduate comes from a family of good genes. Her father and brother are engineers, and her mother is a mathematician.</p>
<p>Fish said she felt “relieved that I managed to solve the problem after so long”, and didn&#8217;t agree with the assessment of her family&#8217;s gifted intelligence, shyly remarking that they were “just OK”.</p>
<p>Announcing the discovery yesterday, UCT dean of health Bongani Mayosi likened its importance to the first heart transplant, performed by Dr Christiaan Barnard at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town in 1967.</p>
<p>Mayosi began hunting for the gene himself as a young scientist in 1996. “Half of [people] will meet their Maker through sudden death,” he said. “This will help us understand a common problem by taking it forward to develop drugs that target this particular gene.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve taken God&#8217;s own experiment of an inherited condition to understand the causes of sudden death.”</p>
<p>Key to making the discovery was a new technique, whole
exome sequencing, which analyses every gene in a human&#8217;s DNA.
Shaboodien told Fish about the technique after finding out about it during a trip to Italy.</p>

<p>“We called it genetics on steroids. Without this technique we would not have made this discovery.”</p>
<p>Shaboodien said the discovery would help put South Africa on the map in genetics and showed “that we are capable of being on par with international researchers”.</p>
<p>The clinical importance of the discovery meant early detection of unsuspecting people with ARVC was now possible.</p>
<p>But Krause said testing for ARVC would not be easily<br />
accessible for most people, and the UCT research centre where they worked was one of the few places in South Africa where genetic screening was done.</p>
<p>“I think it&#8217;s important to understand there isn&#8217;t available [public] diagnostic screening in South Africa. In [the private sector] you can get blood sent overseas to be screened,” she said.</p>

<p>The party called Mahlangu a &#8220;killer&#8221; for being driving force to move patients from Life Esidimeni homes to unregistered NGOs. The NGOs were found to have been unsafe‚ crowded‚ without sufficient heating and without skilled staff. At least 94 people died from hunger‚ dehydration and diseases unrelated to mental health.</p>
<p>Mahlangu&#8217;s decision was described as &#8220;reckless&#8221; by health ombudsman Professor Malegapuru Makgoba.</p>
<p>Mahlangu&#8217;s resignation was announced on Wednesday by the Gauteng Premier.</p>
<p>The EFF says it will lay charges against anyone else implicated in the killing of the patients.</p>
<p>The ANC Youth League has also indicated it wishes to lay charges of murder against the former health MEC.</p>
<p>Jack Bloom of the Democratic Alliance said: &#8220;It took 141 days for Mahlangu to resign following the first disclosure of deaths in reply to my question in the Gauteng Legislature on 13 September last year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bloom continued: &#8220;Premier (David) Makhura has failed badly in this matter and needs to keep his promises to ensure that action is taken against all those implicated‚ including criminal charges.&#8221;</p>
<p>The DA&#8217;s health spokesman said Mahlangu&#8217;s replacement‚ Dr Gwen Ramokgopa‚ was a poor MEC when she was in charge.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not impressed with the return of Dr Gwen Ramokgopa as MEC of the Gauteng Health Department‚&#8221; said Bloom. &#8220;She was mediocre in this position previously and does not have the drive to fix this deeply dysfunctional department.&#8221;</p>

<p>The draft, aimed at setting ownership and transformation targets for the sector, was opposed by the industry even though it acknowledged that the current document was in many respects an improvement on the previous one proposed by Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe’s predecessor Mosebenzi Zwane.</p>
<p>The draft charter had a requirement of 10% ‘free carry’ interest for mining communities and employees on new mining rights as part of the proposed 30% black equity ownership target.</p>
<p>The contents of the bill will have an effect on trade union Solidarity’s current strike against white employees being excluded from Sasol’s Khanyisa share scheme.</p>

<p>Mentor, a PhD student from the University of the Western Cape (UWC) has just returned from a prestigious science conference in Germany, and is already preparing for her next visit to the USA.</p>
<p>Mentor’s five-day trip to Germany late last month came after being selected to attend the 68thLindau Nobel Laureate Meeting, which is one of the most prestigious science conferences in the world.</p>
<p>She was one of six South African female scientists nominated by the Academy of Science of South Africa to attend the event, which hosted 600 of the world’s most intelligent individuals, including Nobel Prize-winning scientists, who shared their ideas on physiology and medicine.</p>
<p>“Mentor has just heard she’s been awarded a Fullbright Scholarship from the University of Missouri in the USA, and is currently preparing her visa and other necessary documents for her departure in September. She will be away for nine months,” explains Harriet Box, UWC’s communications officer.</p>
<p>But the young scientist’s journey with UWC and in the field started when she joined the university’s work-study programme catering to students predominantly from previously disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
<p>Stepping stone</p>
<p>She worked as a student assistant and anatomy practical demonstrator, and lectured postgraduate students in basic tissue culture techniques at the university’s Medical Biosciences Department.</p>
<p>Mentor was also an assistant lecturer, teaching aspects of neurobiology, reproduction and metabolism to community health students, and is already a published scientist in prominent scientific journals, and the first recipient of the coveted national Wyndham Prize from the Physiology Society of Southern Africa in 2014.</p>
<p>As part of Mentor’s doctoral studies, she plans to redefine the theoretical interpretation of the functional composition of the brain’s protective barrier properties.</p>
<p>“My original research was situated squarely within the context of substance abuse. My neighborhood, like many others in the greater Cape Town, experiences high levels of substance abuse, in particular methamphetamine – and this inspired me to look at the science behind it,” Mentor explains in a statement.</p>
<p>“In my honors year I investigated the effects of methamphetamine on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, since the mechanism may be linked to the integrity of the BBB, which regulates the movement of ions, pathogens, and an array of harmful substances across brain capillaries, protecting the cognitive integrity of the central nervous system.</p>
<p>“UWC has been my stepping stone in many respects. I’m looking forward to learning more about how my research may one day be able to make a meaningful contribution to treating addiction.”</p>

<p>SOLA Future Energy installed a solar photovoltaic system providing the additional power for the Cedar Mill Mall that state-owned power utility Eskom could not supply.</p>
<p>Eskom indicated that it was able to supply only 250 kVA of continuous power due to constraints on the grid, while the mall’s developers, Noble Property, needed at least 500 kVA to get the project off the ground.</p>
<p>“The solution was to utilise the substantial roof space on the mall to install 2580 solar panels with a capacity of 851kW,” SOLA Future Energy CEO Dominic Wills said.</p>
<p>Thanks to the solar PV and an additional battery system, electricity can also be supplied to the mall independent of the central grid, making the centre resilient to power outages that often plague small, remote municipalities.</p>
<p>“In addition to providing power to the grid and off-grid, the exciting potential of solar PV technology is that it can provide solutions that supplement the grid. This technology is deployable in rural settings, where electricity connections are often limited,” said Wills.</p>
<p>The new shopping centre is expected to create 300 permanent jobs.</p>

<p>The Robben Island Museum this week joined in criticism of the auction‚ saying they were shocked to hear of it. The Nelson Mandela Foundation also distanced itself from it.</p>
<p>In a statement‚ the CEO SleepOut said it had not intended any offence.</p>
<p>The trustees extended their &#8220;sincere apologies if they have offended anyone in their quest to raise funds for worthy causes‚ as this is certainly not its intent&#8221;.</p>
<p>The initiative was not unauthorised‚ the trustees stated.</p>
<p>&#8220;The CEO SleepOut Trust has been in ongoing discussions with Robben Island since early 2017 regarding the 2018 event.</p>
<p>&#8220;In March 2018 The CEO SleepOut Trustees visited Robben Island to meet with the Robben Island Board. At this meeting all of the campaigns relating to the 2018 Robben Island Event were mutually strategised and subsequently agreed upon which included the following main elements:</p>
<p>&#8211; The CEO SleepOut Project was given access to all the Maximum-Security jail cells for the Event</p>
<p>&#8211; It included the use of the Maximum-Security Courtyard as well as Nelson Mandela’s Cell No. 7</p>
<p>&#8211; The Auction of Cell No. 7 was agreed upon.</p>
<p>&#8211; The CEO SleepOut Project was given exclusive use of the required infrastructures at Robben Island to see the Event come to fruition‚ including the exclusive use of the Robben Island Ferries after the last public ferry at 14:00 on the 18th July. Access to their vehicles on the island‚ access to their tour guides‚ who are all former prisoners‚ access to water and electricity and access to the lime quarry and a night tour of the island.&#8221;</p>
<p>Furthermore‚ at the 2018 SleepOut Movement launch in May 2018‚ the campaigns &#8211; including the Robben Island edition &#8211; were presented at the ANC-affiliated Chancellor House. The launch was attended by &#8220;the Robben Island appointed spokesperson‚ the trustees said‚ &#8220;in addition to all involved stakeholders‚ spokespersons and beneficiaries&#8221;.</p>
<p>While it is unclear if the event is going ahead‚ the trustees emphasised their goal was to raise funds for deserving causes.</p>
<p>The beneficiary of the Robben island No. 7 Cell auction was the Prison-to-College Pipeline Project‚ developed through a partnership between Stellenbosch University and the Department of Correctional Services as well as Western Cape community organisations‚ with the aim of integrating prisoners back into their communities.</p>
<p>&#8220;. . .The funds raised through the auction of his cell was to go directly to benefitting prisoners in South Africa and assisting with their re-integration into society.&#8221;</p>
<p>During its three years in South Africa‚ the trustees said The SleepOut Movement has raised almost R53-million for philanthrophy.</p>

<p>Acsa said Cape Town International Airport, East London Airport, Port Elizabeth International Airport and Kimberley Airport would be renamed as part of the government’s Transformation of Heritage Landscape programme.</p>
<p>The public has until Wednesday to comment.</p>
<p>The renaming of Cape Town International Airport has been in the spotlight since the funeral of Struggle icon Winnie Madikizela-Mandela at Orlando Stadium, when EFF leader Julius Malema said it should be named after her.</p>
<p>Acsa said that following that Transport Minister Blade Nzimande had directed them to facilitate the process of changing the airport’s name to Nelson Mandela International Airport to honour the country’s icon.</p>
<p>“The renaming will be implemented in terms of the SA Geographical Names Council Act of 1998 (Act No 118 of 1998).</p>
<p>“The minister of arts and culture is responsible for the approval of geographical names after receiving recommendations from the SA Geographical Names Council.</p>
<p>&#8220;The council is responsible for geographical features of national concern including towns, cities, suburbs and any form of human settlement, post offices, stations, highways, airports and government dams,” Acsa said.</p>
<p>An application will then be made to the relevant Geographical Names Provincial Committee for processing.</p>
<p>These committees will verify that the applications comply with the guidelines in the national Handbook on Geographical Names.</p>
<p>“Once the names have been approved by the minister they will then be published in the Government Gazette.</p>
<p>&#8220;A period of 30 days is required for any objections to be submitted in response to the Government Gazette.</p>
<p>&#8220;Should any objections be received, the minister of arts and culture will assess them before a final decision is published in the Government Gazette.”</p>
<p>Proposals and comments should be sent to Acsa by close of business on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Proposals and comments may be sent by e-mail to Corporate.Affairs@airports.co.zaor delivered by hand to the Acsa office at the nearest airport.</p>

<p>Motorists whose fines have progressed to warrants of arrest are now able to pay them on paycity.co.za‚ rather than sending a cheque through the mail or paying in person. To use the site‚ motorists will have to register‚ then agree to an admission of guilt form. After paying‚ the city will send a receipt and a warrant recall form directly to their email.</p>
<p>JP Smith‚ the city’s mayoral committee member for safety and security‚ said Cape Town will be sending out SMS and email messages to those with outstanding fines to notify them of the online system.</p>
<p>“This is a massive step towards increased service delivery and makes things a lot more convenient for offenders who are trying to do the right thing by paying their fines‚ including those residing outside of Cape Town‚” he said.</p>
<p>Smith encouraged those with outstanding fines to pay through the online system‚ noting that it will help them avoid any “unpleasant surprises” when stopped at a roadblock. The warrant recall form can be used as proof for motorists stopped at a roadblock that the warrant has been revoked.</p>

<p>More than 17 000 people attended the ninth edition of the Hillclimb, held in Knysna from 4 to 6 May, about 2000 more than last year’s record-breaking attendance.</p>
<p>Records tumbled</p>
<p>When the action drew to a close, all-new King of the Hill records had been established in each of the three categories, but the times between many of the top contenders were closer than ever, which kept the fans on their toes right to the end of the nail-biting programme.</p>
<p>Apart from the battle being waged between the competitors, the throngs of fans had plenty of other attractions – most notably the daring antics of Jaguar’s world-renowned stunt driver and multiple record-holder Terry Grant.</p>
<p>
Image: Motorpress</p>
<p>The British ace entertained the crowds by not just driving up the 1.9km Simola Hill in the Jaguar F-Pace, but doing so the whole way on two wheels! He had several celebrities, including singer Bobby van Jaarsveld and Springbok rugby captain Eben Etzebeth, as passengers along on the hair-raising rides for a remarkable once-in-a-lifetime experience!</p>
<p>Single Seaters and Sportscars</p>
<p>Andre Bezuidenhout was the undisputed King of the Hill at the 2017 edition of the Hillclimb in his 1989 Dallara F189 Formula One car, and his aim for the 2018 event was to go even quicker in the recently acquired Gould GR55 – a specialist Hillclimb single-seater built in the United Kingdom with much-improved aerodynamics and a paddle-shift transmission.</p>
<p>Even though he had limited seat time in the Gould leading up to the Hillclimb, he was astonishingly quick throughout the weekend, and wrapped up the qualifying sessions with a best time of 36.006 seconds – more than 1.1 sec quicker than his best time last year in the Dallara.</p>
<p>Signalling his clear intent, Bezuidenhout established a new official Hillclimb record during the one-lap Class Finals with an impressive time of 36.428 seconds.</p>

<p>Bezuidenhout said: &#8220;I felt confident throughout the weekend that a 35-second time was possible but was slightly worried when the temperature dropped in the late afternoon for the final run. The Gould is an amazing car, and the team I had supporting me was superb.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been an amazing weekend, and this is an exceptional event. I can’t think of another motorsport event where so many people stay right to the end and are so enthusiastic. I have to say well done to the organisers and sponsors.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="210" height="158" src="https://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6-210x158.jpg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="" style="float: left; margin-right: 5px;" /><p>The 2018 Jaguar Simola Hillclimb delivered an enthralling mix of thrills and excitement, with some stunning new records being set on the Simola Hill – both amongst the competitors’ times, as well as the number of spectators attending the three-day event.</p>
<p>More than 17 000 people attended the ninth edition of the Hillclimb, held in Knysna from 4 to 6 May, about 2000 more than last year’s record-breaking attendance.</p>
<p><strong>Records tumbled</strong></p>
<p>When the action drew to a close, all-new King of the Hill records had been established in each of the three categories, but the times between many of the top contenders were closer than ever, which kept the fans on their toes right to the end of the nail-biting programme.</p>
<p>Apart from the battle being waged between the competitors, the throngs of fans had plenty of other attractions – most notably the daring antics of Jaguar’s world-renowned stunt driver and multiple record-holder Terry Grant.</p>
<p><em><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10690" src="http://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.1.jpg" alt="" width="626" height="430" srcset="https://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.1.jpg 626w, https://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.1-291x200.jpg 291w, https://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.1-16x11.jpg 16w, https://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.1-32x22.jpg 32w, https://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.1-28x19.jpg 28w, https://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.1-56x38.jpg 56w, https://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.1-64x44.jpg 64w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /><br />

<p>The British ace entertained the crowds by not just driving up the 1.9km Simola Hill in the Jaguar F-Pace, but doing so the whole way on two wheels! He had several celebrities, including singer Bobby van Jaarsveld and Springbok rugby captain Eben Etzebeth, as passengers along on the hair-raising rides for a remarkable once-in-a-lifetime experience!</p>
<p><strong>Single Seaters and Sportscars</strong></p>
<p>Andre Bezuidenhout was the undisputed King of the Hill at the 2017 edition of the Hillclimb in his 1989 Dallara F189 Formula One car, and his aim for the 2018 event was to go even quicker in the recently acquired Gould GR55 – a specialist Hillclimb single-seater built in the United Kingdom with much-improved aerodynamics and a paddle-shift transmission.</p>
<p>Even though he had limited seat time in the Gould leading up to the Hillclimb, he was astonishingly quick throughout the weekend, and wrapped up the qualifying sessions with a best time of 36.006 seconds – more than 1.1 sec quicker than his best time last year in the Dallara.</p>
<p>Signalling his clear intent, Bezuidenhout established a new official Hillclimb record during the one-lap Class Finals with an impressive time of 36.428 seconds.</p>
<p>If that wasn’t remarkable enough, he absolutely destroyed the current lap record – and the opposition – with an all-new time of 35.528 seconds in the King of the Hill Top 10 Shootout. That translates to an average speed of 192.52km/h, from a standing start!</p>
<p>Bezuidenhout said: &#8220;I felt confident throughout the weekend that a 35-second time was possible but was slightly worried when the temperature dropped in the late afternoon for the final run. The Gould is an amazing car, and the team I had supporting me was superb.</p>

<p>Robert Wolk was another prominent presence throughout the two days of racing, competing this time in a Ferrari V8-powered A1 GP car.</p>
<p>He put in a solid effort to both learn the new car and give it his all, and finished second with a best time of 37.691 seconds during the Top 10 Shootout.</p>
<p>Another talking point throughout the contest was Stuart White, at just 16 years old, who became a strong contender for a podium slot too, but his hopes were dashed when his Formula Renault V6 failed on his Top 10 run, and he had to take solace in a Class Final time of 40.497 seconds.</p>
<p>So, the final podium slot went to Garth de Villiers, driving a Formula VW, with a time of 42.013 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Modified Saloon Cars</strong></p>
<p>As predicted, the large field that made up the Modified Saloon Car category dished up a non-stop menu of drama and excitement.</p>
<p>At any point during the Hillclimb’s five practice sessions and six qualifying runs, there were no less than eight contenders vying for this year’s Modified Saloon Car King of the Hill title.</p>
<p>Among the four-wheel drive challengers, reigning champion Wilhelm Baard, in the leading Nissan GT-R, had his sights set on a third Hillclimb title, going head-to-head against fellow GT-R rivals Edrich Zwiers, Quinsley Sale, Martin van Zummeren, Darron Gudmanz and Kyle Mitchell.</p>
<p>Anton Cronje led the Japanese assault with his wild Subaru Impreza WRX STi, while Franco di Matteo brought sheer muscle to the gunfight – courtesy of his Jaguar V8 Supercar racer.</p>
<p>Heading into the Class Final, Dawie Joubert held the qualifying advantage, having dipped under the 40-second barrier with a time of 39.984 seconds, with Baard breathing down his neck a mere hundredth of a second adrift and the next three rivals, comprising Charl Joubert, Di Matteo and Van Zummeren, all under 41 seconds.</p>
<p>However, Baard was having a torrid weekend, struggling with the braking balance of the car, already having destroyed the GT-R’s radical front splitter, and had a wild spin at the top of the Simola Hill on Saturday. Today, he had to contend with a fire breaking out in the GT-R, leading to more emergency repairs.</p>
<p><em><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10695" src="http://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.3.jpg" alt="" width="626" height="430" srcset="https://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.3.jpg 626w, https://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.3-291x200.jpg 291w, https://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.3-16x11.jpg 16w, https://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.3-32x22.jpg 32w, https://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.3-28x19.jpg 28w, https://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.3-56x38.jpg 56w, https://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.3-64x44.jpg 64w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /><br />

<p>Nevertheless, he managed to pull a blinder of a run out the hat in the Class Final, blasting through the timing beam in 39.533 seconds to set a new record for the class. In the Top 10 Shootout, run from slowest to fastest, it was anyone’s guess who would take the all-or-nothing single shot at glory.</p>
<p><strong>Casualties of &#8216;war&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>In the mid-pack it was Cronje that laid down the gauntlet with a time of 40.973 seconds, which was immediately beaten by Van Zummeren and Di Matteo. Charl Joubert was up next and he notched up an impressive 39.519 second run.</p>
<p>Baard gave it everything on his final attempt, sliding the GT-R through the Esses at the top of the course, and ripping off his front splitter for the second time in two days when he drifted slightly wide and clipped a tyre.</p>
<p>It only emerged later, at the podium, that the boost pipe was pulled off at the same time, and he completed the run with no turbocharger!</p>
<p>It was a nail-biting affair as the track was cleared of debris, and Dawie Joubert completed the final run of the three-day Jaguar Simola Hillclimb event, eventually ending on 40.025 seconds to claim third behind his brother, with the King of the Hill title ultimately remaining in the hands of an elated Baard who set a new record time of 39.463 seconds.</p>
<p>“We had so many dramas in this event, and with the balance issues with the brakes I didn’t have much confidence in the car yesterday,” he said. “The team worked through the night to sort out the problem, and the car was much better today, which allowed us to focus on improving our times.</p>
<p>“Then there was the small issue of the car catching fire this morning after one of the runs when the dipstick came out the engine, and we had to replace a wiring harness in just half an hour,” he added.</p>
<p><em><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10696" src="http://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.4.jpg" alt="" width="626" height="430" srcset="https://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.4.jpg 626w, https://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.4-291x200.jpg 291w, https://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.4-16x11.jpg 16w, https://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.4-32x22.jpg 32w, https://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.4-28x19.jpg 28w, https://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.4-56x38.jpg 56w, https://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.4-64x44.jpg 64w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /><br />

<p>“We even had a problem in the Class Final with the car not changing down a gear in turn two, but ironically when we checked the data it was actually faster through the corner – so I used this technique to great effect for the Top 10 Shootout.</p>
<p>“I was clearly a bit too quick in the Esses, and despite the damage to the splitter and no boost in the final part of the course, somehow I managed to set the quickest time, which was quite astonishing,” Baard recalled.</p>
<p>“Just about everything seemed to go wrong this weekend, but eventually it all clicked together right at the end. The team and I are exhausted but very happy.”</p>
<p><strong>Road-going Saloon Cars and Supercars</strong></p>
<p>Reghard Roets earned his second King of the Hill title in a row with another exceptional performance in the mighty street-legal Nissan GT-R, having set the pace throughout the weekend.</p>
<p>As the lone GT-R in the category, he raised the bar even further after he beat his current Hillclimb record for standard road cars by 0.135 seconds, bettering last year’s result during the Class Finals with a time of 44.631 seconds.</p>
<p>The former Production Car racer had actually gone even quicker in the qualifying sessions, with a time of 44.588 seconds, in an effort to stave off the challenge from a trio of McLaren 570S entries, and the ever-present threat of Dawie Olivier in the roaring Jaguar F-TYPE SVR.</p>
<p><em><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10697" src="http://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.5.jpg" alt="" width="626" height="430" srcset="https://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.5.jpg 626w, https://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.5-291x200.jpg 291w, https://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.5-16x11.jpg 16w, https://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.5-32x22.jpg 32w, https://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.5-28x19.jpg 28w, https://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.5-56x38.jpg 56w, https://www.newspages.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.5-64x44.jpg 64w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" />Image: Motorpress</em></p>
<p>The Top 10 Shootout for the King of the Hill title became a thrilling three-way tussle at the top, with Olivier blasting his way to his best time of the weekend of 44.967 seconds, a time that Izak Spies wasn’t able to beat in his McLaren after recording a run of 45.784 seconds.</p>
<p>Roets was the last of the contenders and cemented his 2018 King of the Hill title with a winning time of 44.892 seconds. “I was a bit nervous going into the final run, but I did just enough to get the win in the bag, so I’m ecstatic,” he said.</p>
<p>This gave the Jaguar driver second place on the final podium with Spies taking the third-placed slot ahead of Ernst du Preez (McLaren), Barry Ingle (Roush Ford Mustang) and Jacques Wheeler in the third McLaren.</p>
<p>A noteworthy mention has to go to multiple karting and rally champion Mark Cronje who delighted the crowds with his outstanding performance in the large and luxurious Jaguar XJR 575, completing the Top 10 dash in a very respectable time of 48.485 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Spirit of Dave Charlton Award</strong></p>
<p>Few names are better known in South African motorsport circles than Willie Hepburn – a man that has become synonymous with racing thundering V8 machines over the years in the WesBank V8 series.</p>
<p>He has been a regular and popular competitor at the Jaguar Simola Hillclimb in his iconic 7.0-litre Chevrolet V8-powered Opel Record – a car that he still drives and maintains at an age of 76.</p>
<p>For his dedication to the sport and professionalism, Hepburn earned the Spirit of Dave Charlton floating trophy for the 2018 King of the Hill, which recognises the person that reflects South African race legend Dave Charlton’s spirit of impeccable attention to detail, meticulous preparation and commendable performance.</p>

<p>The conference will be held from 21-23 of August 2018 in conjunction with Internet industry conference iWeek, which will run from 20-24 August 2018.</p>
<p>AfPIF is an annual event that serves as a platform to expand and develop the African Internet. It connects infrastructure, service, and content providers with policymakers in order to identify and discuss ways to improve network interconnection, lower the cost of connectivity, and increase the number of users in the region.</p>
<p>More than 200 participants attended last year’s AfPIF in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire including providers of international, regional, and sub-regional transport, transit, and content as well as more than 20 IXPs from Africa and beyond.</p>
<p>This year’s event will be hosted in South Africa, home to the oldest Internet Exchange Point (IXP) in Africa, the highest density of IXPs per city in Africa, and the largest carrier neutral data centre in Africa. As a thriving terrestrial infrastructure market and the continent’s most mature peering ecosystem, South Africa will provide an opportunity for attendees to learn from its experiences and explore a growing number of opportunities in the region.</p>
<p>“The African IXP Association has been absolutely amazed by South Africa’s rapid development and is proud to host this year’s AfPIF in Cape Town. We all benefit from their innovation and continued success, and hope that our collective presence will provide additional momentum,” says Kyle Spencer, co-coordinator of the African IXP Association.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to be hosting AfPIF at iWeek for the very first time. This is a fantastic example of the kind of pan-African ICT cooperation envisioned by the Abuja and OR Tambo declarations of the 1990s,” says ISPA chair Graham Beneke.</p>
<p>“The first AfPIF was held in 2010 by the Internet Society from the realization that most of African Internet traffic is exchanged outside the continent, and the region could save costs by exchanging the Internet traffic locally,” says Dawit Bekele, regional bureau director for Africa at Internet Society. “The target is to have at least 80% of the Internet traffic consumed in Africa being locally accessible, and only 20% sourced outside the continent by the year 2020. We are getting closer to that target every year thanks to AfPIF and many activities that promote interconnection and hosting in Africa.”</p>

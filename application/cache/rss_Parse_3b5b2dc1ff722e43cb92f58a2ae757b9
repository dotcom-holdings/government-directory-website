<p>The Southern African Development Community (SADC) Double Troika Summit of Heads of State and Government was held in Pretoria on Friday to discuss the political and security issues of Lesotho. The summit was chaired by President Jacob Zuma as the Chairperson of regional bloc.</p>
<p>“In the interim, the summit approved an expanded mandate and composition of a total of 34 members of the oversight committee to include military, security, intelligence and civilians and experts to be deployed to Lesotho for a period of a month,” SADC Executive Secretary, Dr Stergomena Lawrence Tax said.</p>
<p>She said the summit directed the Chiefs of Defence and Security to assess the requirements and determine the appropriate size of the contingent force and to prepare the modalities for the deployment.</p>
<p>Dr Tax was addressing delegates at the summit convened after the recent political and security developments in Lesotho. Among other things, the Commander of the Lesotho Defence Force Lieutenant General Khoantle Motsomotso was assassinated on 5 September reportedly by army officers in his military headquarters.</p>
<p>“[The] summit strongly condemned the brutal assassination of Lieutenant General Motsomotso and expressed condolences to the family of the late commander, government and the people of the Kingdom of Lesotho,” she said.</p>
<p>The summit urged the Kingdom to expedite investigations into the assassinations of Lieutenant General Motsomotso as well as former Commander of the Lesotho Defence Force, Brigadier Maaparankoe Mahao, who was killed in June 2015.</p>
<p>President Zuma expressed concern at the killing of Lieutenant General Motsomotso, saying that it sets a dangerous pattern.</p>
<p>“The tragic death of Lieutenant General Motsomotso should not be allowed to pass by unnoticed by our regional organisation, especially because it happens two years after the killing of [Brigadier Mahao],” President Zuma said, as the Chairperson of SADC.</p>
<p>“The prevailing situation in this sister country should not be allowed to continue forever as if it is business as usual. There is a need for decisive action by the region,” President Zuma said</p>
<p>At the time of his death, Lieutenant General Motsomotso dedicated his talent, time and energy towards contributing to a stable, peaceful and prosperous Lesotho by starting to implement the recommendations of the SADC Commission of Inquiry.</p>
<p>President Zuma called on all Basotho, led by the government and teaming up with all national stakeholders, to work together for peace, security and stability in the Kingdom.</p>
<p>“As a region, we are committed to assist the Government and people of Lesotho to implement all SADC decisions including the required constitutional, security sector, parliamentary, public sector and judicial reforms.</p>
<p>“We believe that the Kingdom can only achieve lasting and sustainable stability once these reforms are implemented,” he said. The reforms have to be owned and led by the Basotho, with SADC providing technical assistance and advice.</p>

<p>Thabane&#8217;s remarks came after the country&#8217;s King Letsie moved to dissolve parliament this week after Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili, who is also the leader of the Democratic Congress (DC) party lost a confidence vote. This, consequently, paved was for an election within three months.</p>
<p>Mosisili had headed a coalition government since a snap election in 2015 that was called in an effort to end the country&#8217;s prolonged power struggles.</p>
<p>But the coalition recently became fragmented, and parliament voted in favour of Monyane Moleleki to replace Mosisili. Moleleki&#8217;s Alliance of Democrats (AD) party split from the DC last year.</p>
<p>He, however, said that his party, the All Basotho Convention (ABC), was ready to contest the election.</p>
<p>Thabane said that the ABC together with other opposition parties were going to take the election exercise &#8220;very maturely&#8221;, and would tell the electorate about the outgoing prime minister&#8217;s abuse of office.</p>
<p>Thabane recently returned home with two other opposition leaders, vowing to win back power.</p>
<p>Taking a swipe at Mosisili, Thabane said if only the constitutional processes had been allowed to take place, a new majority party would have emerged in parliament.</p>
<p>He accused Mosisili of having failed to implement the resolutions that were taken by the regional bloc, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) task team.</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest failure by the outgoing prime minister was ignoring the SADC calls for reforms in the military, particularly its involvement on issues of civilian politics,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Thabane said he was going to meet with the king on Thursday afternoon to discuss &#8220;some important issues&#8221; affecting the country.</p>

<p>Mr Makosholo said this while opening the labour inspection workshop in Maseru this week. The workshop brought together stakeholders for deliberations on possible collaborations to increase efficiency labour issues.</p>
<p>The three-day workshop was organised by the ministry under its Strengthening Labour Inspections Project, which is funded by the United States Department of Labour (USDOL) and supported by International Labour Organisation (ILO).</p>
<p>Lesotho ratified ILO Convention No.81 in 2001 on Labour Inspection in Industry and Commerce, and therefore the country has an obligation to provide and maintain a system of labour inspection to ensure the protection of workers in industrial and commercial workplaces.</p>
<p>He said the workshop came at an opportune time when the ministry was on the verge of completing the Lesotho Labour Policy which is a step towards ensuring that the national law reforms are operationalised.</p>
Meanwhile, the Association of Lesotho Employers and Business (ALEB), expressed concern over some inspectors’ inability to carry out their duties as they seemed to lack the requisite skills
<p>He also said that inspection should be a collective exercise involving employers, employees and the government.</p>
<p>Daniel Maraisane, a representative of employee federations welcomed the initiative saying strengthening labour inspection would address many issues that employees face.</p>
<p>He said inspections were necessary to ensure safety of employees among other issues.</p>

<p>Mr Makosholo said this while opening the labour inspection workshop in Maseru this week. The workshop brought together stakeholders for deliberations on possible collaborations to increase efficiency labour issues.</p>
<p>The three-day workshop was organised by the ministry under its Strengthening Labour Inspections Project, which is funded by the United States Department of Labour (USDOL) and supported by International Labour Organisation (ILO).</p>
<p>Lesotho ratified ILO Convention No.81 in 2001 on Labour Inspection in Industry and Commerce, and therefore the country has an obligation to provide and maintain a system of labour inspection to ensure the protection of workers in industrial and commercial workplaces.</p>
<p>He said the workshop came at an opportune time when the ministry was on the verge of completing the Lesotho Labour Policy which is a step towards ensuring that the national law reforms are operationalised.</p>
<h3>Meanwhile, the Association of Lesotho Employers and Business (ALEB), expressed concern over some inspectors’ inability to carry out their duties as they seemed to lack the requisite skills</h3>
<p>He also said that inspection should be a collective exercise involving employers, employees and the government.</p>
<p>Daniel Maraisane, a representative of employee federations welcomed the initiative saying strengthening labour inspection would address many issues that employees face.</p>
<p>He said inspections were necessary to ensure safety of employees among other issues.</p>

		<title>LESOTHO URGED TO SWITCH TO TERTIARY SECTOR RELIANCE</title>

<p>The call was made by the Head of Strategic Research at Nedbank Group, Mohammed Nalla during Tuesday’s corporate breakfast meeting organised by Nedbank Lesotho.</p>
<p>The annual event, which was attended by captains of industry and representatives from the public sector is meant to provide an opportunity to deliberate on the latest business and economic issues affecting Lesotho and the region.</p>
<p>Lesotho is heavily dependent on its manufacturing industry to produce textiles and garments for export. The industry is the second largest employer after the public service.</p>
<p>The textile and garment industry is mostly anchored on the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which is a preferential trade concession by the United States.</p>
<p>AGOA provides for duty-free and quota free entry of goods into the US from designated sub-Saharan African countries, including Lesotho, and applies to both textile and non-textile goods.</p>
<p>He said although AGOA had helped create many jobs in the region, it had however failed to attract domestic investment for the development of the industry.</p>
Lesotho’s textile and garment industry employs an estimated 40 000 people but the investment comes from Taiwanese and Chinese investors
<p>He also said that utilisation rates of AGOA by the region had been very low given the impressive variety of products that are eligible to the US market under the trade concession.</p>
<p>A total of 6421 product lines are granted AGOA duty-free preference into the US market.</p>
<p>Former Finance Minister Thimothy Thahane, who also attended the event, said while the region could benefit from focusing on the tertiary sector, it could only be sustainable through investment in technical skills development.</p>

<p>This was recently revealed by Mining Minister Lebohang Thotanyana while presenting an annual update on the status of the mining sector in the country in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>The latest figures indicate an increase from M852 million in the 2014/15 financial year and the minister said this translated into a 10 percent contribution to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).</p>
<p>To date, the mining sector has attracted a total foreign investment injection of US$500 million (about M7.1 Billion) and created 3000 skilled and unskilled jobs for locals.</p>
Mr Thotanyana also took the opportunity to outline the ministry’s plans for further development, saying five new diamond mines would soon be opened
<p>Currently, Lesotho’s operational diamond mines are Letšeng Diamonds and Storm Mountain Diamonds also known as Kao mine.</p>
<p>Mr Thotanyana further stated the ministry was also planning to attract investment of at least M5 billion that would help create an additional 10 000 jobs.</p>
<p>Mr Thotanyana said they had employed different strategies to explore for other minerals as part of the ministry’s efforts to diversify the type of minerals mined in the country.</p>

<p>They said while commercial agriculture had potential to drastically reduce hunger while creating jobs and improving the lives of Basotho, this could not be achieved due to the fragmentation in the sector.</p>
<p>They said with the exception of wool and mohair farmers, the rest of smallholder farmers were just scattered around the country resulting in the failure to access formal markets due to inadequate production capacity; difficulty in raising concerns and difficulty in finding relevant assistance to develop their enterprises.</p>
<p>However, this could soon be a thing of the past, as one of the ZEHADEF founders, Lerato Tanka said they had started the process of establishing a formal network for all farmers.</p>
Mr Tanka said as the first step, ZEHADEF was seized with collecting information and registering all farmers in a database
<p>“Due to fragmentation, it becomes difficult to raise concerns, find relevant assistance, meet market demands and have greater buying power in order to minimise costs,” said Mr Tanka in an interview with the Business Journal.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, we want to build a network of smallholder farmers who are able to produce top quality products which will appeal to the local and international market.</p>
<p>“We humbly call upon all Basotho in various sectors of agriculture, trained and untrained to join as we take steps which will pave a way for sustainable agriculture.”</p>
<p>ZEHADEF also intends to create value-added linkages where some of the agricultural products would be processed to manufacture other products.</p>
<p>The forum currently has 150 members and has agents in all 10 districts to attend to queries about its operations.</p>

<p>MusicTime as the service is called, is operated through installing a software application (app) on a handset to stream and download music from both local and international recording artists.</p>
<p>The telecommunications giant’s customers would be charged from their data bundles for accessing the service, while the artists whose songs will be carried on the platform will also receive compensation from ETL.</p>
<p>According to ETL’s Chief Executive Officer Leon de Fleuriot, the new platform brought convenience to customers with their favourite music just a tap away.</p>
ETL’s General Manager – Products and Services Lebeko Sello chipped in saying the new service was accessed by downloading the MusicTime app and then dialling *100# to register
<p>Mr Sello also revealed all new registrations would enjoy free 60 minutes listening time which is valid for seven days.</p>
<p>He said the app enables users to create their own playlists, follow stars and celebrities and also see what other people are listening to.</p>
<p>The service is currently available to prepaid subscribers but plans are underway to avail it to post-prepaid customers.</p>
Commenting on the development, music producer Thulo Monyake commonly known as T- Mech or Lemekoane, welcomed the initiative, saying it was going to empower local artists through royalties
<p>“Given that music royalties in Lesotho are still not a reality, I see this initiative as the right way to go since it would allow us to generate income from our music,” said Mr Monyake who is the managing director Magic In Progress (MIP).</p>
<p>He said the initiative would also encourage local artists to be more professional and to produce better quality music which can be accessed by anyone from anywhere in the world.</p>

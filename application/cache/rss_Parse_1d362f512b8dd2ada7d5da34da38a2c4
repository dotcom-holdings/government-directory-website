<p>And managing up – which can mean anticipating needs and coming up with solutions without being asked – has never been as important as it is now, as workplaces are under increasing demand to adapt to rapid change.</p>
<p>Changing hierarchies</p>
<p>Workspaces are increasingly fluid, with more people working remotely, on contract, and consultancy bases – a phenomenon tied to the rise of the gig economy. The old ladder-style hierarchy, with its clear structure of leadership, is changing.</p>
<p>In the gig economy, people will increasingly find that they must work with a large variety of leaders at different times, some above and some below them; this constant rotation means that an ability to manage up is that much more important.</p>
<p>So how can people prepare themselves to be more effective at managing up?</p>
<p>1. Learn to anticipate</p>
<p>Figure out what issues your boss is most stressed or concerned about. If you can anticipate a deadline ahead of time, come up with a list of solutions and/or an update of where the team is with the current challenge, you can help a boss move through challenges by providing information timeously.</p>
<p>There are many traps that one can fall into in the bid to make a boss happy &#8211; but essentially managing up is understanding where the stresses lie and taking. As the Harvard Business Review commented, managing up does not, and should not, have to entail sucking up!</p>
<p>2. Solve problems effectively</p>
<p>If you are going to say you have everything covered, make sure that you do. Have a multi-point plan in place to move an issue forward, demonstrating that you know the issue and have a well-considered solution.</p>
<p>Managing up may have moments of grand ideas or big money insights, but it’s primarily about understanding the bigger picture, recognising issues or opportunities, being able to prioritise information, and coming up with well thought out ways to take things forward. If you can provide this type of approach for your boss, you will be worth your weight in gold.</p>
<p>3. Get buy-in</p>
<p>Even if your plans are impeccable, you won’t get anywhere if your boss is not open to your suggestions. Their buy-in is something you may have to manage carefully, particularly if it involves potential criticism. A good rule of thumb is never to challenge leadership in public, as it’s likely to lead to defensive pushing back (part of all leadership is managing egos, after all).</p>
<p>It is usually better to reserve disagreements or criticism for discussion in private. Along with this, it is usually most effective to couch these critiques in a clear understanding of the pressures or realities your boss is facing. In other words, it is much more likely that your input will be appreciated if you start with something like: “I know that the biggest pressure you have on you at the moment is the recent drop in the Rand value, so I thought it was [...]]]></description>

In other words, it is much more likely that your input will be appreciated if you start with something like: “I know that the biggest pressure you have on you at the moment is the recent drop in the Rand value, so I thought it was important to tell you…”.</p>
<p>4. Build trust</p>
<p>Like so many things in life, managing up comes down to building trust with management.</p>
<p>Dr Badri Zolfaghari, a senior lecturer at the UCT Graduate School of Business whose research interests include trust development, puts it this way: &#8220;Our disposition to trust, which is a psychological state, affects the extent to which we are willing to tolerate risk and uncertainty. Therefore, the higher our disposition to trust, the more likely we are to accept […] challenges.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moreover, Zolfaghari adds that when it comes to trusting others, we assess trustworthiness based on our belief in their ability, benevolence and integrity – and this influences our perception of whether they&#8217;ll be willing or able to address challenges.</p>
<p>Trust, as they say, is earned, and is essential in the process of managing up.</p>
<p>Understand what makes your boss tick, and what ticks them off, too. Chances are that you will disagree at times, but the trick is to do so constructively, without losing respect or trust.</p>
<p>5. Give others a chance too</p>
<p>Of course, part of the discussion around managing up is understanding the environment “below” you. Are you allowing others to manage up to you effectively? Are you creating an environment in which a team can recognise the needs and pressures around you, and come up with solutions?</p>
<p>Who are you promoting and hiring?</p>
<p>Are you hiring people with an opinion (and the efficacy to let you know what it is) or yes-people?</p>
<p>Ultimately, managing up is about doing your best to help; you can only truly do that if you understand who you are managing and whether they are above or below you in the organisation.</p>
<p>While the easy trap for &#8220;managing up&#8221; can be &#8220;sucking up&#8221;, it’s really about understanding the people you’re working with, the pressure they’re under, and how your work and their work feeds into each other.</p>
<p>Leaders who can do this are not only excellent at their own jobs, they “manage up” to their bosses in impactful ways and create more empowered and engaged colleagues below them. Any organisation that has leaders capable of this is bound to be more effective.</p>

The man who is following me has good hair and dead eyes. It would seem wherever I go on the internet, he pops up. He is young, very young, but is constantly telling me that he has the wisdom and the secret stuff that can help me.</p>
<p>He keeps telling me he is very rich and desperately wants to help people. This is why he will help me become very rich, too. He always seems to be at a mansion with a couple of Ferraris in the background. The snake-oil gospel of success. PT Barnum without a real circus.</p>
<p>I have a name for these people. I call them the internet class. My definition of the internet class is people who have no discernible skills, but seem to make money by claiming they can explain things. They don’t make anything tangible, but have loads of information and answers they claim makes them experts. They repackage what exists and explain what is already known to people who are desperate for answers. They promise everything but deliver very little.</p>
<p>The internet class</p>
<p>I think our industry is starting to have its own internet class. Now, I know, advertising has always been full of hustlers. But, the hustle, for creatives at least, has always been about trying to make things. The hustle was the way, never the end goal.</p>
<p>One of the great comforts of being a creative is that you know, in the end, after all the talk, something will have to be made. There will be evidence of industry. The process will lead to something other than itself. This simple fact guarded against words being more important than things. The result is what counted.</p>
<p>For many that is still true. However, in my travels I have started to meet a certain type of person. Other creatives have described them to me as well.</p>
<p>“They have good hair, the right trainers and a fixed smile. The know all the work. They know all the buzzwords. In the first meeting, they are very impressive. In the second one, less so. Their gift is, they can explain everything and anything. They just don’t know how to make anything. They have vague titles and even vaguer skills. You find them everywhere. They are spread across the advertising universe like the black space between stars.”</p>
<p>The internet has given them the information, the platform and the words. They don’t think. They don’t have to. They just explain. They tell you that you don’t understand, but they have the formula. They know the secret. It is very seductive and very palatable, in a world where things are getting faster and faster. The danger is, as an industry, we could end up drinking our own snake oil and wondering why we are still not feeling well.</p>

It is this single factor instilled in individuals since childhood that has contributed to stereotyping and prejudice across societies and cultures. Stories have instigated wars and political mudslinging, racial segregation and gender discrimination, generational and cross-country hostility, and bitterness between low and high-income communities.
Even Africa is perceived in a certain way because of the stories being told about it. The role of traditional media and social media are key players in the way the world views Africa, and possibly contributes to putting the brakes on the continent’s development.
How do the stories we disseminate shape how the rest of the world views Africa? How does it affect foreign investment? How does it influence markets and economic output? These are some of the questions we should be asking, along with how to change our one-sided approach.
Even research indicates that attitudes and views have been shaped in a specific manner.</p>
<p>Influence
The US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), for example, explored the neurobiology of listening to stories and how attitudes and behaviours can change. It found that storytelling changes views about people for the better or worse and significantly influences societies.</p>
<p>“Narrative exerts a powerful influence on human thoughts and behaviour. They consolidate memory, shape emotions, cue heuristics and biases in judgment, influence in-group/out-group distinctions, and may affect the fundamental content of personal identity,” it states.
Meanwhile Octavia Utley’s curriculum at the Yale-New Haven Teacher’s Institute explored this tradition in Africa. She found that storytelling throughout history made it possible for African cultures to pass on knowledge, history and experiences from one generation to the next, manifesting itself in different ways and serving many purposes.</p>
<p>“It was used to interpret the universe, resolve natural and physical phenomena, teach morals, maintain culture values, pass on methods of survival and praise God,” said Utley in her paper titled, Keeping the tradition of African storytelling alive.</p>
<p>This data tells us that a story is not just a story. Narratives have shaped societies, and the world has been significantly affected by the stories we have told about each other. Collectively we have all in some way contributed to bias stories without due consideration of its consequences.</p>
<p>So how do we change our views from what was instilled in us as children, and how do we ensure the next generation do not stereotype others?</p>
<p>Perceptions
There are many layers to unravel and now is the time to review our attitudes and perceptions of others. We need to challenge our internal and exported narrative because this is where behavior change begins. Parents, in particular, need to be mindful about the type of stories they tell their children, and be aware of books they are reading.</p>
<p>Now is the time for the people of Africa to tell a new story. Tell the world about our unique heritage, majestic views, vibrant fashion and tasty foods. Tell them about our talented youth, our humanitarians, our innovations, and our uniquely African projects.

<p>This interchange is designed to provide continuous access to the Verulam, Phoenix, Mount Edgecombe, uMhlanga Ridge Town Centre and the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast.</p>
<p>Corné Roux, the Eastern Region project manager for SANRAL said that the biggest challenge was accommodating the traffic during construction.</p>
<p>“The interchange sits on a major national road, the N2, and the M41 feeds major residential, industrial and commercial areas such as Phoenix, Mt Edgecombe and uMhlanga carrying high volumes of traffic which had to be kept moving during the interchange’s construction,&#8221; said Roux.</p>
<p>He added that another challenge was the ground conditions that needed the installation of extensive piling to support the interchange structures.</p>
<p>Despite the lengthy construction period and disruptions on this busy stretch of road, motorists are now feeling the benefits of the interchange which has dramatically improved traffic flow through the area.</p>
<p>The new roads have state-of-the-art lighting making the intersection safer and more visible at night while the pedestrian bridge also makes it safer and more convenient for people to cross the N2.</p>
<p>According to Roux, the Mount Edgecombe Interchange is now a landmark structure and an important artery of the greater eThekwini metropolitan highway system for easing traffic, relieving congestion and is also a significant business enabler.</p>
<p>Managing Director of Tongaat Hulett Developments Michael Deighton said, “Not only has the new interchange improved driving conditions in this previously congested area but it will also unlock significant development opportunities planned for the KwaZulu-Natal north coast&#8221;.</p>

<p>A journey from &#8216;talent&#8217; to &#8216;tactics&#8217;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a breed of new online personalities who are taking &#8216;the news&#8217; away from the mainstream media.</p>
<p>I believe deeply in being a &#8216;constant producer&#8217;.</p>
<p>Writing and publishing books is one of the key expert-positioning techniques I recommend. No doubt, publishing books, particularly credible books with commercial publishing houses, helps to position you as a thought leader in your industry.</p>
<p>Otherwise, write what you can. But write it.</p>
<p>Growing experts in Africa</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where the local application comes in. I strongly believe Africa needs more experts, more icons, more standouts.</p>
<p><strong>But how do we get there?</strong> That’s the hard part. <strong>How do you translate raw aspiration into a practical road-map?</strong></p>
<p>Some of the ideas – actually most of them – are the sort of thing you’re never taught at school, and rarely find in business books. But maybe it&#8217;s time to do things a little differently.</p>
<p>It helps to dissect all the nuts and bolts, the explicit to-do items for becoming a leading name in any industry.</p>
<p>It helps to be cheeky and industry agnostic.</p>
<p>I think of it as a sort of blueprint for personal greatness, drawing on different industry icons and on what they’ve done that really works.</p>
<p>Douglas Kruger is a speaker and business author. What Makes Them Great? 50 Ways to Become an Industry Leader is his sixth book with Penguin Random House SA.</p>

<p>The draft, aimed at setting ownership and transformation targets for the sector, was opposed by the industry even though it acknowledged that the current document was in many respects an improvement on the previous one proposed by Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe’s predecessor Mosebenzi Zwane.</p>
<p>The draft charter had a requirement of 10% ‘free carry’ interest for mining communities and employees on new mining rights as part of the proposed 30% black equity ownership target.</p>
<p>The contents of the bill will have an effect on trade union Solidarity’s current strike against white employees being excluded from Sasol’s Khanyisa share scheme.</p>

<p>A net importer of crude, Africa’s most industrialised economy wants biofuels initially to meet two percent, or about 400 million litres, of the country’s annual fuel consumption to wean itself off oil imports and improve the trade balance.</p>
<p>However, regulatory uncertainty centred on financial support incentives to manufacturers has choked investment since the approval of a national biofuels strategy in 2007.</p>
<p>“The department will be tabling this biofuel framework to cabinet for its consideration and approval before end of March 2019,” said Jeff Radebe in a speech prepared for an energy conference in Cape Town.</p>
<p>The framework deals with, among other things, the mandatory purchase of biofuels by licensed manufacturers and feedstock plans that do not compromise food security, said Radebe.

An over prioritisation of content plans has led marketing professionals to believe that the value of a social media strategy is all about impressions, comments and likes.</p>
<p>Single essence of online presence</p>
<p>Content plans definitely have their place in the eco-system of a social media strategy, however, for many it’s become the single essence of their online presence and this is concerning.</p>
<p>I recently had the opportunity to speak at The Sunday Times Next Generation Conference about this exact issue. I want to share a few ways that we can break beyond the content plan in our social media strategy and start making the most of this incredible technology that our customers use every single day.</p>
<p>To form the foundation of these ideas I need to state these primary insights about people and social media:</p>
<p>Social media is a crowded environment.</p>
<p>People use brands to build their own brand.</p>
<p>The post-truth era has degraded trust in information. More than ever, a consumer’s perception becomes their truth.</p>
<p>The power of social media is not in likes and comments. The power in social media is that it builds relationships.</p>
<p>Content plans push us towards distribution thinking. Distribution thinking does not build trust, which is the bedrock of good relationships.</p>

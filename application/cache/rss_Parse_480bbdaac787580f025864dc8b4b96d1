<p>Since the start of demarcation protests in the Vuwani area of Vhembe, residents especially in the Mashau village, have reported that they have been unable to receive their ARVs. Clinic staff told them that they had not received stock due to the protests in the area, as all the roads were barricaded.</p>
<p>However, Thabiso Teffo, spokesperson for Limpopo Health MEC Dr Phopi Ramathuba, said this was not true.</p>
<p>“I can confirm with you that no shortage of medicine, namely ARVs, was reported due to the unrest in the area,” said Teffo.</p>
<p>“The only challenge which we are having is the shortage of the Lamivudine 300mg, but it is not caused by the protests in area, but it is a national problem which we are currently experiencing at the moment.</p>
<p>“Even though we are currently experiencing shortages when it comes to the supply of Lamivudine, we are currently prescribing a combination of Tenovir and Lamivudine to all our patients,” he added</p>
<p>“I can assure you that all our facilities have the fixed-dose combination ARVs,” said, Teffo. Over 85 percent of patients are on FDC ARVs.</p>

<p>This is according to 2015 research by the Global Hygiene Council (GHC).</p>
<p>The study of more than 9 000 people across 17 countries, including South Africa, also found that the average person misses 4.5 days of school or work due to an infection and 91% of people reported taking at least some time off work or school due to an infection in 2014.</p>
<p>“The socio-economic implications of cold and flu, such as health complications, lost productivity, school absenteeism, and cost of healthcare can be limited by avoiding the spread of flu and cold,” said GHC member Dr Kgosi Letlape.</p>
Letlape said colds and flu are respiratory infections transmitted by a virus
<p>Although infections happen throughout the year, more people tend to be infected with cold and flu throughout the autumn and winter. According to Letlape, contrary to popular belief, colds and flu are not caused by the weather.</p>
<p>The biggest reason the illnesses are more prevalent in winter is because people tend to stick very close to each other because it’s so cold, which means the chance of passing on illness-causing germs is a lot higher.</p>
<p>The influenza season is usually between the last week of April and the first week of July, but according to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) this can change year to year.</p>
<p>Nhlanhla Shongwe, a mother of two from Vosloorus, told Health-e News that during winter she spends more than R300 on flu medicine for her children.</p>
Steve Mabona, spokesperson for the Gauteng Department of Health, said for the 2015/16 year the department procured 1150 units of flu vaccine to the value of R64331
<p>“The burden of flu is usually high during winter, however, public health facilities have enough stock and never run out of vaccines,” said Mabona.</p>
<p>He added that the department procured flu vaccines annually at the beginning of each flu season, which are then given to specific target groups namely – pregnant women, people with chronic medical conditions, including people living with HIV and Aids, and pensioners.</p>

<p>More than 80 grannies from Makuya village, near Niani in Limpopo participated in a recent fun walk which was organised by the local community leaders to educate the elderly about how to fight diabetes and high blood pressure.</p>
During the walk, the senior citizens were not only encouraged to exercise but to eat healthily in order for them to stay fit and live long
<p>“We are very grateful for this day. It means a lot to us as the senior citizens. Exercise is the only thing which can keep us going for years still healthy, because as we grow older we tend to forget about exercising and all we do is to eat and sleep,” said Grace Makuya, a 73-year-old who participated in the fun walk.</p>
<p>“Even though I felt very tired after the walk, I wish we can do this every day as it can help us to stay fit.”</p>
<p>The fun walk is expected to be an annual event from now on.</p>
The senior citizens who participate in the fun walk were mainly women from various parts of the rural Makuya and surrounding villages
<p>“If they organise another walk like this one I am going to participate as I enjoyed myself today. I am happy because it shows us that our leaders care about our health and well being,” said Joice Luvhengo.</p>
<p>“We were also encouraged to eat healthy food and to stay away from junk food so that we can be healthy and live long”, she added.</p>
Thivhonali Makuya, one of the brains behind the fun walk, was very happy with the turnout:
<p>“We are trying to figure out how we can make this walk a weekly event as it can help a lot of grannies to keep fit and help them to fight various diseases as exercise is of much important to each and every individual regardless of age” said Makuya.</p>
<p>South Africa has the highest overweight and obesity rate in Africa, with up to 70% of women and a third of men being classified as overweight or obese. A staggering 40% of women in our country are obese, which means they have a body mass index greater than 30 kg/m2.</p>

<p>The new law brushed aside the critics, who wanted the legislation to cover people with degenerative diseases, Reuters reports.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, after weeks of political wrangling, the upper Senate Chamber voted in favour of a law which makes Canada one of the few nations where doctors can legally help sick people die.</p>
Some members of parliament were against the scope of the law saying it is too narrow and should not be restricted to those facing imminent death
<p>The Liberal government, though, narrowed the scope of the legislation to cover only those people whose death was reasonably foreseeable. Forward</p>
<p>Government officials said the new law is a first attempt to address a highly sensitive and controversial topic and could be broadened in years to come.</p>

<p>The centre, which will accommodate 900 inpatients, opened its doors on 26 June and already has 200 patients.</p>
<p>According to Morgan Mkhatshwa, the Life Esidimeni’s managing director, the Life Recovery Centre and Halfway House will cater for substance abuse patients in Gauteng, and target the West Rand region, where there’s a great need for such services.</p>
<p>“The Life Recovery Centre is a high-quality hospital based substance abuse treatment centre for those who cannot afford private rehabilitative care,” said Mkhatshwa.</p>
Master Sithole, a recovering addict, told Health-e News that he was trapped in drugs for 15 years and encouraged parents to give their children all the attention they needed before they sought it elsewhere
<p>“There is no drug I didn’t smoke, and there is nothing that I didn’t steal,” said Sithole. “I started smoking after matric because things were not looking good for me.”</p>
<p>Sithole now counsels drug addicts and refers those in need to rehab centres.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Deputy Minister of Social Development Hendrietta Bogopane Zulu urged people not to judge addicts but to help them “because they did not choose or fill in application forms to become drug addicts”.</p>
<p>She said for communities to win the drug battle they needed to work together and take collective responsibility for all children. “Unless we get that right, we are never going to win this battle,” she said.</p>

<p>Now the former wrestler turned movie action hero has decided to turn his weekly habit into an app called The Rock Clock.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The free app is fairly simple in that it works as a goal tracker and alarm clock.</p>
The unique part comes via the very personal involvement of The Rock in the fabric of the app itself
<p>Each wake up alarm sound (25 in all) was selected by The Rock and even the menus are written in style of the actor&#8217;s own words, with prompts like &#8220;Wake my ass up at [select a time].&#8221;</p>
<p>One alarm sound is actually the actor&#8217;s own voice, humorously saying &#8220;beep, beep, beep,&#8221; along with a funny quip in the middle of the vocal droning.</p>

You can also opt to sync your wake up alarm with The Rock&#8217;s own wake up schedule
<p>However, since one of his most recent wake up times was 4:30 a.m., this particular feature is probably not for the casual fan.</p>
<p>The app also delivers regular personal video messages from The Rock in the same style as many of his social media posts, but focused solely on motivational messages.</p>
The Rock teased the app about a week ago on Instagram, and it&#8217;s just one part of a new motivational initiative he&#8217;s launching called Project Rock
<p>In addition to the app, the actor is also offering Project Rock apparel through his deal with Under Armour.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve spent over a year engineering this app for you,&#8221; wrote The Rock on Instagram on Monday. &#8220;Our goal was create a free, direct, uncomplicated, cool, motivating app to help us all get after our goals every morning.  I also wanted to totally disrupt the traditional &#8216;morning alarm&#8217; system we all use on our phones.&#8221;</p>
The Rock has maintained a direct social media relationship with his fans long before the app, so keeping the personal message content going from his side shouldn&#8217;t be problem
<p>The question now is whether or not the muscle-bound entertainer&#8217;s daily encouragement will actually result in real app-powered personal progress for his fans.</p>
<p>The app is currently available for both iOS and Android.</p>

<p>Health meets technology, here are the best apps and wearables for calorie count and fitness:</p>
Best fitness trackers for calorie counting &#8211; Jawbone UP3
<p>&#160;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jawbone&#8217;s latest wearable, the UP3 is packed full of some of the most advanced sensors in the space, which means it takes measuring your calorie burn each day.</p>
<p>UP3 tries to take out the guesswork, using data about your height, weight, activity intensity and duration from its huge range of sensors.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
Under Armour HealthBox
<p>&#160;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The HealthBox is made up of the Under Armour Band fitness tracker, heart rate monitor chest strap and smart scales. You can step on the scales and the in formation will be combined with your food logging data.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
Best apps for calorie counting- MyFitnessPal app
<p>&#160;</p>
<p></p>
<p>MyFitnessPal app (iOS, Android, Blackberry, Windows) is leagues ahead of the rest when it comes to calorie counting and diet management. It has your vitals and what you want to achieve &#8211; gain, lose or maintain weight .</p>
<p>MyFitnessPal estimates how many calories your body burns without additional exercise. It&#8217;s then your job to log everything you eat and drink.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
Best for coaching: HAPIcoach
<p>&#160;</p>
<p></p>
<p>HAPIcoach app claims to get you eating better in just five days. The idea is to take photos of what you eat, logging at least 10 meals over those five days.</p>
<p>A nutrition expert will then be able to analyse your eating habits and gradually over time help you make substantial and worthwhile changes with your diet.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
Best for fitness trackers: Lose It!
<p>&#160;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Like MyFitnessPal, it&#8217;s built around deciding how much weight you want to lose. Then you&#8217;re given a daily calorie budget to work from. It uses your phone to scan barcodes to log meals and will calculate how many calories you&#8217;ll burn from a session in the gym.</p>
<p>It also takes into consideration all the other factors that can affect a diet such as sleep and your macronutrients intake.</p>
<p>Keeping things social is a big part of how Lose It! works. You can join groups, share your favourite meals and enter challenges to keep you motivated.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center"><strong>Best for fitness trackers: Lose It!</strong></h2>

<p>Like MyFitnessPal, it&#8217;s built around deciding how much weight you want to lose. Then you&#8217;re given a daily calorie budget to work from. It uses your phone to scan barcodes to log meals and will calculate how many calories you&#8217;ll burn from a session in the gym.</p>
<p>It also takes into consideration all the other factors that can affect a diet such as sleep and your macronutrients intake.</p>
<p>Keeping things social is a big part of how Lose It! works. You can join groups, share your favourite meals and enter challenges to keep you motivated.</p>

This was sighted by a senior UNAIDS official quoting a recent United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund study that found the number of adolescent deaths from AIDS-related illnesses has tripled since 2000.</p>
<p>To mark World Aids Day, The World Health Organisation and the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS has emphasized expanding Anti-Retroviral Therapies to all people living with the virus is key to ending the epidemic by 2030.</p>
<p>Despite major strides in combatting the spread of HIV, AIDS is the leading cause of death among African teenagers and the second most common killer globally.</p>
<p>The UNAIDS office head, Simon Bland says, “ I talked about adolescent deaths tripping since 2000, that translates to 26 infections every hour. It&#8217;s the top cause of death for 15-19 year olds in Africa, the second largest cause of deaths for adolescents globally. I have seven out of 10 of those infections are girls, so girls way disproportionately affected other than boys. And half of these are in just six countries and so targeting those six countries is crucially important.”</p>
<p>Those six countries are South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Mozambique, Tanzania and India as the drive to close the gap between those infected and those on ARV treatment intensifies.</p>
<p>“If we look today at around 37 million people living with HIV and around 15 or 16 million people on treatment, there&#8217;s 21 million who need treatment today who don&#8217;t get it and around 19 million of those don&#8217;t know their status so there has to be a huge effort on testing, on getting the testing out.”</p>
<p>If we are to get on the fast-track to really beat this trajectory and end AIDS by 2030, we&#8217;ll need to invest even more than we&#8217;re investing today</p>
<p>“So innovations help with point of care diagnostics, cheaper and rapid diagnostics but it&#8217;s going to take a big push to get out there. We as part of our strategy have launched a target of 90-90-90 where by 2020 we want to get 90% of people infected with HIV tested so that they know their status, 90% of them having access to treatment and 90% of them having their virus suppressed,” Bland says.</p>
<p>Despite huge falls in infection rates, globally, around 2 million people became infected in 2014; 1.4 million in sub Saharan Africa with over one million deaths globally in the same year.</p>
<p>UNAIDS estimating that by 2020, they will require $ 31 billion annually to break the trajectory of the virus.</p>
<p>Bland says, “If we are to get on the fast-track to really beat this trajectory and end AIDS by 2030, we&#8217;ll need to invest even more than we&#8217;re investing today. Presently we calculate global investments of around 20 and 22 billion; we estimate that by 2020 we&#8217;ll need around 30-31 billion if we are to break the trajectory. 7.4 billion in low income countries, 10 billion in lower middle income countries and close to 14 million in upper middle income countries.”</p>

<p>The broad takeaway is that getting those carrying the virus onto ARV treatment is indeed lifesaving.</p>
<p>The rise in adolescent deaths over the last 15 years was often as a result of a lack of access to medication for those teenagers, many of whom were infected during infancy.</p>
<p>Despite broad availability of diagnostic testing globally, only half the people with HIV around the world know that they are carriers.</p>
<p>Thus closing the gap between knowing ones status and getting treatment remains among the biggest challenges in stopping the spread of HIV with the next 15 years.</p>

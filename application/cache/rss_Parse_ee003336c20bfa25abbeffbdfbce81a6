<p>The hearings kicked off in the Northern Cape town of Springbok on Tuesday and will also start in Limpopo on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Parliament&#8217;s Joint Constitutional Review Committee has been tasked to determine whether or not Section 25 of the Constitution should be amended.</p>
<p>According to Section 25 of the Constitution, property may be expropriated for a public purpose or in the public interest.</p>
<p>It also states that subject to compensation, the amount, time it takes and manner of payment, should be agreed to by those affected or decided or approved by a court.</p>
<p>Committee co-chairperson, Lewis Nzimande, says that the committee received a wide range of views on the issue of expropriating land without compensation.</p>
<p>“The variety includes, amongst others, the concern about the property rights, private land and even the land that is in the hands of the state and that, that is in the mining companies and commercial farmers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Northern Cape leg of the hearings will continue in Upington on Thursday, Kuruman on Friday and Kimberley on Saturday.</p>
<p>Hearings will also start at the Ephrahim Mogale Town Hall in Limpopo today.</p>
<p>The committee is expected to report back to Parliament by 28 September.</p>

<p>The technical team is made up of all provincial departments. The Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) on Thursday said the IMC has noted that the situation in Vuwani in Vhembe District is still volatile and unstable, as a shutdown continues to rage in some parts of LIM345.</p>
<p>This follows a meeting held by the IMC on Wednesday. The IMC has welcomed progress made towards implementing the decisions taken to stabilise the situation and return life to normal in LIM345.</p>
<p>According to the department, the meeting emphasised an urgent need for services to be provided in all wards of Lim345.</p>
<p>“As per the stakeholder engagements agreements, the Vuwani office was opened on 7 September to render services to communities. Of concern is that even though there is progress being registered as agreed, the shutdown still continues in some parts of LIM345 and this is disappointing,” the department said.</p>
<p>The meeting also noted an extensive stakeholder consultation process that has been undertaken by the provincial government.</p>
<p>The IMC has urged all the stakeholders to continue working together to address the issues raised during the consultation. Concern was raised that some stakeholders do not take the process seriously as they fail to attend meetings.</p>
<p>The IMC chairperson and Cogta Minister, Des van Rooyen, said the non-attendance of meetings by some stakeholders, like the Pro-Makhado Demarcation Task Team, flies in the face of efforts aimed at resolving challenges and this might suggest that they are negotiating in bad faith.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the IMC, we recognise an important role that all stakeholders play in the process of finding an amicable solution to the challenges raised, hence we are sounding a clarion call for more fruitful engagements.”</p>
<p>The meeting noted that the ongoing shutdown in some parts of LIM345 negates the progress being made, including the opening of offices in Vuwani.</p>
<p>Shutdown affects learners</p>
<p>School learners remain the most affected, especially those in Grade 12 as they have missed their preliminary examinations.</p>
<p>This, the department said, will further affect learners’ ability to finalise preparations for the end of year examinations scheduled to start next month.</p>
<p>On the other hand, businesses in Vuwani are also feeling the strain as a result of the shutdown.</p>
<p>The IMC has condemned the continued shutdown, as it denies communities their right to access services.</p>
<p>The IMC has also called on all parents and community members to take a stand against the senseless, destructive and unnecessary inconvenience caused by the shutdown of services.</p>
<p>The department said the Security Cluster will continue to ensure visibility to protect communities and their property.</p>
<p>Vhembe Development Support Package.</p>
<p>With regards to progress made in the implementation of the Vhembe Development Support Package, the department said there are projects from national, provincial and local partners, which include the provision of basic services and social cohesion programme.</p>

<p><strong>Vhembe Development Support Package.</strong></p>
<p>With regards to progress made in the implementation of the Vhembe Development Support Package, the department said there are projects from national, provincial and local partners, which include the provision of basic services and social cohesion programme.</p>
<p>The package outlines various projects that will be undertaken by various government departments and non-government structures.</p>
<p>To ensure proper implementation and monitoring, progress on the implementation of this package has been included as a standing item on the Provincial HOD Forum agenda.</p>
<p><strong>Social cohesion</strong></p>
<p>The IMC has noted that eight social cohesion dialogues have already been staged in Vuwani and the Ministry of Arts and Culture has committed to continue the dialogues and will also do a study to understand the challenges better.</p>
<p>Once these programmes are implemented, the IMC believes that communities will come together and ensure that life goes back to normal.</p>
<p>“From these social cohesion dialogues, it was clear that social co-existence in LIM345 is possible. Some of the communities in that area have been living side by side for years,” said the department.</p>
<p>The IMC has resolved to challenge and dismiss any perceptions or suggestions of tribalism in Vhembe, which seek to suggest that people cannot stay together.</p>
<p>“Ours is a caring government that will always strive and stop at nothing to bring to life the words of former President Nelson Mandela, that ‘no one was born hating another person because of the colour of their skin or background or religion. People learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite,&#8221; said the Minister.</p>
<p>The IMC has urged all communities to unite and contribute to move LIM345 forward. The IMC said any form of discrimination, whether it is masked as tribalism or any form of intolerance, is not acceptable and it will not be tolerated in a democratic South Africa.</p>
<p>“While a temporary solution will be implemented for now, a permanent plan is been sought to deal with all matters amicably,” said Minister Van Rooyen.</p>
<p>The IMC will monitor the situation in Vuwani and also engage all stakeholders and communities in the affected areas of LIM345.</p>

The Deputy Minister of Environmental Affairs, Barbara Thomson, on Tuesday announced the winners of the 7th Greenest Municipality Competition (GMC) in Bloemfontein.</p>
<p>Deputy Minister Thomson acknowledged the role played by South African municipalities in embracing the concept of the green economy by implementing long-term sustainability policies and strategies in partnership with local communities.</p>
<p>“This is an important development for our country because it demonstrates an increasing awareness and realisation that our prosperity as a country is inextricably connected to the well-being of our environment,” Deputy Minister Thomson said.</p>
<p>The overall winners will receive R3.5 million, first runner-up R3 million and the second runner-up R2.5 million. The money will be disbursed through funding of infrastructure projects aimed at the protection of the environment.</p>
<p>The prize is tied to waste, climate change and green economy related job creation projects.</p>
<p>The Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality and the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Municipality respectively won the first and second runner-up in the metro category, while the Govan Mbeki Municipality and the Hessequa Local Municipality won the local municipality category.</p>
<p>“Funding the competition is of greater strategic importance, as it helps to galvanise municipalities to initiate projects that address their Integrated Development Plans (IDPs) and forged links with our Extended Public Works Programme mandate of creating temporary employment and offering skills development opportunities.</p>
<p>“The Greenest Municipality Competition has evolved into a significant contributor towards a collective response to the challenges posed by climate change and government’s course towards a sustainable future. It focuses on sustainable development in areas such as good waste management practices, efficient energy use, sustainable water use, public participation and best practice of municipal leadership,” the Department of Environmental Affairs said.</p>
<p>Deputy Minister Thomson said the Greenest Municipality Competition is an important enabler in the transition towards greener municipalities, which contributes towards the country’s collective response to the challenges posed by climate change and South Africa’s path towards a sustainable future.</p>

The charismatic Tsonga musician and reality television star will tomorrow donate about 12000 books to schools in his area of Nkuri Sifasonke in Giyani, Limpopo.</p>
<p>Penny Penny, real name Eric Nkovani, said he has always recognised the importance of schooling and had wished his children would not be like him.</p>
<p>&#8220;School is important and knowledge is the future. Education will help you live a good life. I worked on a farm at 10, and then went to the mines. I also sold vegetables in the streets because I never got an education. I&#8217;ve never been inside a classroom; I don&#8217;t have an idea of what happens in there.</p>
<p>&#8220;All that I have and know is self-taught. I was so embarrassed after I asked a friend to read to me a letter that was sent from home when we were in the mines, I then decided to learn how to write and read my name and then developed from there.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said when his father died in 1965, leaving his mother &#8211; who was one of his 27 wives &#8211; he had to fend for himself and his mother.</p>
<p>The books were donated by the Rotary Club and will fill libraries of primary and high schools in the area. His reality show Papa Penny Ahee is currently shooting its upcoming season and is scheduled to be back on TV by October.</p>

The charismatic Tsonga musician and reality television star will tomorrow donate about 12000 books to schools in his area of Nkuri Sifasonke in Giyani, Limpopo.</p>
<p>Penny Penny, real name Eric Nkovani, said he has always recognised the importance of schooling and had wished his children would not be like him.</p>
<p>&#8220;School is important and knowledge is the future. Education will help you live a good life. I worked on a farm at 10, and then went to the mines. I also sold vegetables in the streets because I never got an education. I&#8217;ve never been inside a classroom; I don&#8217;t have an idea of what happens in there.</p>
<p>&#8220;All that I have and know is self-taught. I was so embarrassed after I asked a friend to read to me a letter that was sent from home when we were in the mines, I then decided to learn how to write and read my name and then developed from there.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said when his father died in 1965, leaving his mother &#8211; who was one of his 27 wives &#8211; he had to fend for himself and his mother.</p>
<p>The books were donated by the Rotary Club and will fill libraries of primary and high schools in the area. His reality show Papa Penny Ahee is currently shooting its upcoming season and is scheduled to be back on TV by October.</p>

<p>The ECD came into being as a result of a call by Deputy President Ramaphosa on World TB Day for the creation of Early Childhood Development facilities in areas with a high TB burden, with a particular focus on children under the age of five.</p>
<p>Cipla South Africa, a pharmaceutical company that manufactures world class generic medicines at affordable prices, answered Deputy President Ramaphosa’s call by establishing the centre.</p>
<p>Deputy President Ramaphosa will on behalf of Cipla officially handover the centre. The facility will afford children an opportunity to develop through play and other creative activities such as age-appropriate computer skills.</p>
<p>The facility will also improve the health and wellbeing of children through access to adequate nutrition and health services. This will ensure that children meet the normative developmental milestone of being able to read, write and count when they start schooling.</p>
<p>The handover ceremony coincides with the world wide Nelson Mandela Day celebrations, which are observed annually, since its declaration in 2009 by United Nations. The day is marked by 67 minutes of selfless good deeds to the vulnerable and disadvantaged.</p>
<p>Deputy President Ramaphosa will be accompanied by the Premier of Limpopo Province Stanley Mathabatha and Members of the Provincial Executive including MEC for Health Phophi Ramathuba, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi, Social Development Deputy Minister Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu, Cipla South Africa CEO Paul Miller, Local Mayors , Traditional Leaders, and other dignitaries.</p>

<p>CCBSA is introducing them to the possibilities of entrepreneurship through a concept dubbed Bizniz in a Box. This initiative gives young people between the ages of 24 and 35 and living in townships the opportunity, skills and funding to set up and run their own successful container shops.
From December last year to February this year, total revenue for the first six shops increased from just over R50 000 a month to more than R200 000, demonstrating the great potential of the programme.</p>
<p>Talented young people are selected, trained in marketing, sales, stock management and finance and given access to funding to start their container business – literally a business in a box.</p>
<p>“Aspiring entrepreneurs in SA face a number of challenges including a lack of funding and skills, fierce competition from bigger companies and regulatory challenges. These common hurdles have resulted in high failure rates for small businesses,” says Tsholofelo Mqhayi, head of enterprise and community development at CCBSA.</p>
<p>“Through the Bizniz in a Box process, we’re helping young people set up and manage thriving businesses in their communities.”</p>
<p>The programme grooms young entrepreneurs to run their own businesses through on-the-job training. This means they are assessed on their actual performance in a live environment, rather than in a classroom set-up only. It also gives candidates a taste of what it’s like to operate a micro business independently.</p>
<p>Once they’ve completed repayment of a portion of the capital cost of the store and met the performance criteria, the store is officially handed over to them and their new life as a fully independent entrepreneur begins.</p>
<p>They are also encouraged to start thinking about other opportunities outside their shop, such as opening up a franchised business.</p>

<p>Maryam Fish, 30, of Lansdowne, led an all-female team of researchers at the University of Cape Town, along with Gasnat Shaboodien and Sarah Krause, who made the discovery with researchers from Italy</p>
<p>Fifty years after South Africa performed the world&#8217;s first successful heart transplant, a woman from the Cape Flats has made another landmark medical discovery that could prevent hundreds of cardiac-related deaths every year.</p>
<p>The discovery of a gene that is a major cause of sudden death among under-35s is likely to put South Africa on the map in the world of genetics, showing that the country “is on par with international researchers”.</p>
<p>Maryam Fish, 30, of Lansdowne, led an all-female team of researchers at the University of Cape Town, along with Gasnat Shaboodien and Sarah Krause, who made the discovery with researchers from Italy.</p>
<p>The gene, called CDH2, is found in everyone, but a mutation causes a genetic disorder known as arrythmogenic right ventricle cardiomyopathy (ARVC), which increases the risk of heart disease and cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>Sudden cardiac death is estimated to hit more than five young people in South Africa daily, according to the Medical Research Council.</p>
<p>In under-35s an inherited form of disease of the heart muscle plays a prominent role in fatalities as a result of cardiac arrest.
“We sequenced all the genes in the human genome in two cousins who were affected,” said Fish, explaining that the cousins were identified after a 22-year-old relative died suddenly.</p>
<p>“We then looked for common variants and had a list of 13000, which we narrowed down through a series of filtering criteria until we got the CDH2 variant, which was the most likely causal variant in this family.”</p>
<p>The team then screened the gene in a number of unrelated individuals who also had ARVC.</p>
<p>This added “more evidence to our case that the CDH2 gene was the causal gene for ARVC”.</p>
<p>The soft-spoken PhD graduate comes from a family of good genes. Her father and brother are engineers, and her mother is a mathematician.</p>
<p>Fish said she felt “relieved that I managed to solve the problem after so long”, and didn&#8217;t agree with the assessment of her family&#8217;s gifted intelligence, shyly remarking that they were “just OK”.</p>
<p>Announcing the discovery yesterday, UCT dean of health Bongani Mayosi likened its importance to the first heart transplant, performed by Dr Christiaan Barnard at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town in 1967.</p>
<p>Mayosi began hunting for the gene himself as a young scientist in 1996. “Half of [people] will meet their Maker through sudden death,” he said. “This will help us understand a common problem by taking it forward to develop drugs that target this particular gene.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve taken God&#8217;s own experiment of an inherited condition to understand the causes of sudden death.”</p>
<p>Key to making the discovery was a new technique, whole
exome sequencing, which analyses every gene in a human&#8217;s DNA.

<p>“We called it genetics on steroids. Without this technique we would not have made this discovery.”</p>
<p>Shaboodien said the discovery would help put South Africa on the map in genetics and showed “that we are capable of being on par with international researchers”.</p>
<p>The clinical importance of the discovery meant early detection of unsuspecting people with ARVC was now possible.</p>
<p>But Krause said testing for ARVC would not be easily<br />
accessible for most people, and the UCT research centre where they worked was one of the few places in South Africa where genetic screening was done.</p>
<p>“I think it&#8217;s important to understand there isn&#8217;t available [public] diagnostic screening in South Africa. In [the private sector] you can get blood sent overseas to be screened,” she said.</p>

<p>The party called Mahlangu a &#8220;killer&#8221; for being driving force to move patients from Life Esidimeni homes to unregistered NGOs. The NGOs were found to have been unsafe‚ crowded‚ without sufficient heating and without skilled staff. At least 94 people died from hunger‚ dehydration and diseases unrelated to mental health.</p>
<p>Mahlangu&#8217;s decision was described as &#8220;reckless&#8221; by health ombudsman Professor Malegapuru Makgoba.</p>
<p>Mahlangu&#8217;s resignation was announced on Wednesday by the Gauteng Premier.</p>
<p>The EFF says it will lay charges against anyone else implicated in the killing of the patients.</p>
<p>The ANC Youth League has also indicated it wishes to lay charges of murder against the former health MEC.</p>
<p>Jack Bloom of the Democratic Alliance said: &#8220;It took 141 days for Mahlangu to resign following the first disclosure of deaths in reply to my question in the Gauteng Legislature on 13 September last year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bloom continued: &#8220;Premier (David) Makhura has failed badly in this matter and needs to keep his promises to ensure that action is taken against all those implicated‚ including criminal charges.&#8221;</p>
<p>The DA&#8217;s health spokesman said Mahlangu&#8217;s replacement‚ Dr Gwen Ramokgopa‚ was a poor MEC when she was in charge.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not impressed with the return of Dr Gwen Ramokgopa as MEC of the Gauteng Health Department‚&#8221; said Bloom. &#8220;She was mediocre in this position previously and does not have the drive to fix this deeply dysfunctional department.&#8221;</p>

<p>The party called Mahlangu a &#8220;killer&#8221; for being driving force to move patients from Life Esidimeni homes to unregistered NGOs. The NGOs were found to have been unsafe‚ crowded‚ without sufficient heating and without skilled staff. At least 94 people died from hunger‚ dehydration and diseases unrelated to mental health.</p>
<p>Mahlangu&#8217;s decision was described as &#8220;reckless&#8221; by health ombudsman Professor Malegapuru Makgoba.</p>
<p>Mahlangu&#8217;s resignation was announced on Wednesday by the Gauteng Premier.</p>
<p>The EFF says it will lay charges against anyone else implicated in the killing of the patients.</p>
<p>The ANC Youth League has also indicated it wishes to lay charges of murder against the former health MEC.</p>

<p>The department on Sunday said it had noted the concern by the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) regarding the delay in the delivery of stationery to schools in the province.</p>
<p>However, the department said it is perturbed by an outcry that some schools have not been provided with textbooks.</p>
<p>The department said it is not delivering a new set of textbooks this year, but only top-ups as well as new syllabus for set works with deliveries currently being done to about 222 schools.</p>
<p>With regard to delivery of stationery, the department said it is acutely aware of the constraints faced by the learners who have not yet received stationery.</p>
<p>“We are currently trying by all means to ensure that the delivery is completed by 26 January 2017.”</p>
The department said it intended to participate in the contract arranged by National Treasury in preparation for the current academic year when the previous contract for the stationery expired in 2016
<p>However, due to some delays in finalising the participation, the department had to come up with a contingency measure in October 2016 and commenced with the arrangement of a provincial contract, which was awarded to African Papers Products (Pty) Ltd in December 2016.</p>
<p>It said the bid could not be awarded to more than one supplier due to the material price difference and forgo a huge savings.</p>
<p>The supplier updates the department at least once a day on progress made in order to clear any backlog in an effort to fast-track delivery. It has so far delivered to more than 60% of schools.</p>
<p>The department said the term of the awarded stationery bid is three years, adding that it signed an agreement with the supplier to complete deliveries by June of the preceding calendar year for the next two academic years.</p>
<p>The department said it is considering a longer term procurement model to ensure continuous and uninterrupted delivery of scholastic stationery and textbooks to circumvent recurrence of this challenge in future.</p>

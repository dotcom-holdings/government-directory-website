<p>The EXCO Lekgotla of the North West recently sat in Wolmaranstad to get a progress report on the implementation of different projects from various sectors.   The lekgotla was informed that some water infrastructure projects have been completed and work is underway in various parts of the province to complete others.</p>
<p>The lekgotla acknowledged projects that aim to bring lasting water solutions to communities and the job opportunities they create for locals.</p>
<p>The projects include, among others, the construction of additional boreholes, which are seen as one of the viable solutions in mitigating the demand for water. Currently, there are about 400 operational boreholes in the North West.</p>
<p>“Water is a basic right and communities must never experience water shortages. We acknowledge the current strides in water infrastructure issues and we further call for the acceleration of projects that are currently underway,” North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo said.</p>
<p>The lekgotla also received a presentation from Statistics South Africa, which revealed that in terms of growth in provincial economies, the North West province had the highest change in percentage point growth at 4.9% in 2015.</p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Image: VC Star </p>
<p>The presentation showed that educational attainment is the major contributor to poverty amongst the youth and this, according to the EXCO, poses a challenge to government to further support youth in the pursuit of their studies.</p>
<p>Poverty alleviation for youth </p>
<p>Premier Mahumapelo said the provincial government has resolved to strengthen the support to youth through the Kgetsi ya Tsie Bursary and Skills Development Fund, which is currently funding 498 students to the tune of R48 million.</p>
<p>“We resolved that there should be 17 consortiums as part of VTSD (Villages, Townships and Small Dorpies) entrepreneurship development; cooperatives are to be provided with information on becoming organised into a consortium.</p>
<p>“We will also strengthen government support to SMMEs (Small, Medium and Micro-sized Enterprises), as the driver for job creation through access to funding markets and opportunities. Procurement in the VTSDs is to be accelerated with a bias towards the villages, and district municipalities will kick start Local Economic Development Agencies to unlock economic potential in the province,” said Premier Mahumapelo.</p>
<p>Setsokotsane 10 x10 campaign </p>
<p>The Premier also emphasised that the Setsokotsane 10 x10 campaigns will be institutionalised, as part of broadening access to services that citizens require from government.</p>
<p>The Setsokotsane 10 x 10 campaign is an all-inclusive radical interventionist programme by the Premier, working together with all MECs, as well as people in the province to respond to the triple challenge of poverty, unemployment and inequality.</p>
<p>The campaign, which takes from the 11th to the 20th of every month, seeks to respond to challenges, including water, potholes, lighting in streets and villages, corruption, accessibility, accountability, housing and crime.</p>

<p>CCBSA is introducing them to the possibilities of entrepreneurship through a concept dubbed Bizniz in a Box. This initiative gives young people between the ages of 24 and 35 and living in townships the opportunity, skills and funding to set up and run their own successful container shops.
From December last year to February this year, total revenue for the first six shops increased from just over R50 000 a month to more than R200 000, demonstrating the great potential of the programme.</p>
<p>Talented young people are selected, trained in marketing, sales, stock management and finance and given access to funding to start their container business – literally a business in a box.</p>
<p>“Aspiring entrepreneurs in SA face a number of challenges including a lack of funding and skills, fierce competition from bigger companies and regulatory challenges. These common hurdles have resulted in high failure rates for small businesses,” says Tsholofelo Mqhayi, head of enterprise and community development at CCBSA.</p>
<p>“Through the Bizniz in a Box process, we’re helping young people set up and manage thriving businesses in their communities.”</p>
<p>The programme grooms young entrepreneurs to run their own businesses through on-the-job training. This means they are assessed on their actual performance in a live environment, rather than in a classroom set-up only. It also gives candidates a taste of what it’s like to operate a micro business independently.</p>
<p>Once they’ve completed repayment of a portion of the capital cost of the store and met the performance criteria, the store is officially handed over to them and their new life as a fully independent entrepreneur begins.</p>
<p>They are also encouraged to start thinking about other opportunities outside their shop, such as opening up a franchised business.</p>

<p>“The message is simple: study maths and science. Our State-owned companies (SOCs) need young people with those skills,” she said.</p>
<p>Minister Brown visited the village on Monday, where she handed over a multipurpose community centre in Mokgalwana, Northam.</p>
<p>The Minister said the country’s SOCs are in need of pilots, engineers, accountants and lawyers, among others.</p>
<p>“Last year, the six SOCs in the Public Enterprises portfolio (Eskom, Transnet, Denel, SA Express, SAFCOL and Alexkor) collectively enrolled nearly 9 000 trainees in various critical skills programmes. Additionally, nearly 1 800 learners received bursaries for the current financial year,” said Minister Brown.</p>
<p>South Africa commemorates Youth Month in June. The month pays tribute to the school pupils who lost their lives during the 16 June 1976 uprisings in Soweto.</p>
<p>Eskom key to economy</p>
<p>Minister Brown said Eskom was pivotal to South Africa as it provides the energy needed to keep the country going. Each week, more households get connected to the electricity grid</p>
<p>“Every week, Eskom rolls out electricity connections to more South Africans in more villages across the nation, and it is supplying the power that industry needs,” she said.</p>
<p>The Minister said the power parastatal, which is the fourth largest electricity regulator in the world, is also an important job creator.</p>
<p>“More than 46 000 South Africans work for Eskom, putting food on their families’ tables. This makes it among the largest employers in the country,” she said</p>
<p>The company’s build programme has also provided jobs for many more people in the construction industry.</p>
<p>As the power utility has been subjected to allegations of conflicts of interest and corruption, Minister Brown said it is in the interest of the company and South Africa that the allegations are “proven or removed from the table as quickly as possible”.</p>
<p>The Minister previously announced an investigation to look into coal contracts and procurement.</p>
<p>She said the utility’s billion rand coal contracts were mostly held by white companies.</p>
<p>“Not much has changed. Some of these contracts are coming up for renewal. Those who hold them don&#8217;t want to lose them. We must find ways, when the contracts are renewed, of bringing in more black-owned companies. They must be brought in through legal tender processes,” she said.</p>
<p>Multipurpose centre</p>
<p>The multipurpose centre that Minister Brown handed over has a computer room, sewing room, four tribal offices and a community hall to be used by the surrounding communities.</p>
<p>As a build-up to the National Youth Month programme, the handover was a significant step towards addressing skills shortages, lack of development, and economic exclusion experienced by most young people in Northam.</p>
<p>The centre, which includes a clinic, will benefit the community, said Minister Brown.</p>
<p>“I know that women in poorer communities bear particular burdens, and that access to health facilities for you and your children shouldn&#8217;t be one of them. This clinic will benefit all in the community &#8211; men, women and children. But I am particularly pleased by what it means for women, and [...]]]></description>

<p>Maryam Fish, 30, of Lansdowne, led an all-female team of researchers at the University of Cape Town, along with Gasnat Shaboodien and Sarah Krause, who made the discovery with researchers from Italy</p>
<p>Fifty years after South Africa performed the world&#8217;s first successful heart transplant, a woman from the Cape Flats has made another landmark medical discovery that could prevent hundreds of cardiac-related deaths every year.</p>
<p>The discovery of a gene that is a major cause of sudden death among under-35s is likely to put South Africa on the map in the world of genetics, showing that the country “is on par with international researchers”.</p>
<p>Maryam Fish, 30, of Lansdowne, led an all-female team of researchers at the University of Cape Town, along with Gasnat Shaboodien and Sarah Krause, who made the discovery with researchers from Italy.</p>
<p>The gene, called CDH2, is found in everyone, but a mutation causes a genetic disorder known as arrythmogenic right ventricle cardiomyopathy (ARVC), which increases the risk of heart disease and cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>Sudden cardiac death is estimated to hit more than five young people in South Africa daily, according to the Medical Research Council.</p>
<p>In under-35s an inherited form of disease of the heart muscle plays a prominent role in fatalities as a result of cardiac arrest.
“We sequenced all the genes in the human genome in two cousins who were affected,” said Fish, explaining that the cousins were identified after a 22-year-old relative died suddenly.</p>
<p>“We then looked for common variants and had a list of 13000, which we narrowed down through a series of filtering criteria until we got the CDH2 variant, which was the most likely causal variant in this family.”</p>
<p>The team then screened the gene in a number of unrelated individuals who also had ARVC.</p>
<p>This added “more evidence to our case that the CDH2 gene was the causal gene for ARVC”.</p>
<p>The soft-spoken PhD graduate comes from a family of good genes. Her father and brother are engineers, and her mother is a mathematician.</p>
<p>Fish said she felt “relieved that I managed to solve the problem after so long”, and didn&#8217;t agree with the assessment of her family&#8217;s gifted intelligence, shyly remarking that they were “just OK”.</p>
<p>Announcing the discovery yesterday, UCT dean of health Bongani Mayosi likened its importance to the first heart transplant, performed by Dr Christiaan Barnard at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town in 1967.</p>
<p>Mayosi began hunting for the gene himself as a young scientist in 1996. “Half of [people] will meet their Maker through sudden death,” he said. “This will help us understand a common problem by taking it forward to develop drugs that target this particular gene.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve taken God&#8217;s own experiment of an inherited condition to understand the causes of sudden death.”</p>
<p>Key to making the discovery was a new technique, whole
exome sequencing, which analyses every gene in a human&#8217;s DNA.

<p>“We called it genetics on steroids. Without this technique we would not have made this discovery.”</p>
<p>Shaboodien said the discovery would help put South Africa on the map in genetics and showed “that we are capable of being on par with international researchers”.</p>
<p>The clinical importance of the discovery meant early detection of unsuspecting people with ARVC was now possible.</p>
<p>But Krause said testing for ARVC would not be easily<br />
accessible for most people, and the UCT research centre where they worked was one of the few places in South Africa where genetic screening was done.</p>
<p>“I think it&#8217;s important to understand there isn&#8217;t available [public] diagnostic screening in South Africa. In [the private sector] you can get blood sent overseas to be screened,” she said.</p>

<p>The party called Mahlangu a &#8220;killer&#8221; for being driving force to move patients from Life Esidimeni homes to unregistered NGOs. The NGOs were found to have been unsafe‚ crowded‚ without sufficient heating and without skilled staff. At least 94 people died from hunger‚ dehydration and diseases unrelated to mental health.</p>
<p>Mahlangu&#8217;s decision was described as &#8220;reckless&#8221; by health ombudsman Professor Malegapuru Makgoba.</p>
<p>Mahlangu&#8217;s resignation was announced on Wednesday by the Gauteng Premier.</p>
<p>The EFF says it will lay charges against anyone else implicated in the killing of the patients.</p>
<p>The ANC Youth League has also indicated it wishes to lay charges of murder against the former health MEC.</p>
<p>Jack Bloom of the Democratic Alliance said: &#8220;It took 141 days for Mahlangu to resign following the first disclosure of deaths in reply to my question in the Gauteng Legislature on 13 September last year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bloom continued: &#8220;Premier (David) Makhura has failed badly in this matter and needs to keep his promises to ensure that action is taken against all those implicated‚ including criminal charges.&#8221;</p>
<p>The DA&#8217;s health spokesman said Mahlangu&#8217;s replacement‚ Dr Gwen Ramokgopa‚ was a poor MEC when she was in charge.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not impressed with the return of Dr Gwen Ramokgopa as MEC of the Gauteng Health Department‚&#8221; said Bloom. &#8220;She was mediocre in this position previously and does not have the drive to fix this deeply dysfunctional department.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was announced by North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo while addressing hundreds of high school principals and Schools Governing Bodies (SGBs) chairpersons in Rustenburg recently.</p>
<p>The Premier called the meeting to thank school principals, teachers, SGB members and parents for the support shown to learners during the 2016 schooling year, and to encourage them to continue enforcing efficiency and discipline at all schools.</p>
<p>The Premier said focusing on rural schools is consistent with the provincial government’s VTSD strategy and its efforts to fight poverty. This will also help to ensure that quality teaching and learning takes place at all schools in the province.</p>
The province achieved a pass rate of 86.2% in the 2016 matric exams
<p>From this year onwards, the province will announce matric results per village, township and small dorpie. Premier Mahumapelo also expressed concern about the seemingly high discrepancy between the number of learners who started Grade 1 in 2005 and those who wrote the 2016 matric examinations.</p>
<p>According to the Department of Education and Sport Development, approximately 80 000 learners started Grade 1 in 2005, and only 32 049 wrote the 2016 National Senior Certificate exams.</p>
<p>Premier Mahumapelo was accompanied by Education and Sport Development MEC Sello Lehari and Finance, Economy and Enterprise Development MEC Wendy Nelson at the meeting.</p>
<p>The Premier expressed his satisfaction with the readiness of the province on the first day of schools reopening, saying so far, 98% of schools across the province have received the learner support material they require.</p>

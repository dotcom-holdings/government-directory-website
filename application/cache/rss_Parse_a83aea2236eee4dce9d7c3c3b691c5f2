<p>The small businesses had received support from the Small Enterprise Finance Agency (Sefa) and Small Enterprise Development Agency (Seda).</p>
<p>The aim of the visit to five districts in the Free State is to look into the SMMEs’ existence, their level of development, challenges encountered and possible interventions required. Sefa and Seda are both agencies of the Department of Small Business Development, and they provide financial and non-financial support respectively.</p>
<p>“One of the outcomes of the committee’s strategic plan is to conduct oversight visits in all the nine provinces wherein the department has financially supported enterprises. It is against this backdrop that the committee resolved to conduct an oversight in enterprises supported in the Free State, located in five district municipalities,” committee chairperson Ruth Bengu said on Saturday.</p>
<p>On Monday, the committee will start in Xhariep District Municipality, visiting Ekasi Kitchen Primary Cooperative, SA Gaba Civils (PTY) LTD in Jagersfontein; Xhariep Leather, Ke Nako Water and Processing Cooperative in Trompsburg and Hareketseng Cooperative in Edenburg.</p>
<p>The weeklong visits to SMMEs will conclude on Friday.</p>

<p>CCBSA is introducing them to the possibilities of entrepreneurship through a concept dubbed Bizniz in a Box. This initiative gives young people between the ages of 24 and 35 and living in townships the opportunity, skills and funding to set up and run their own successful container shops.
From December last year to February this year, total revenue for the first six shops increased from just over R50 000 a month to more than R200 000, demonstrating the great potential of the programme.</p>
<p>Talented young people are selected, trained in marketing, sales, stock management and finance and given access to funding to start their container business – literally a business in a box.</p>
<p>“Aspiring entrepreneurs in SA face a number of challenges including a lack of funding and skills, fierce competition from bigger companies and regulatory challenges. These common hurdles have resulted in high failure rates for small businesses,” says Tsholofelo Mqhayi, head of enterprise and community development at CCBSA.</p>
<p>“Through the Bizniz in a Box process, we’re helping young people set up and manage thriving businesses in their communities.”</p>
<p>The programme grooms young entrepreneurs to run their own businesses through on-the-job training. This means they are assessed on their actual performance in a live environment, rather than in a classroom set-up only. It also gives candidates a taste of what it’s like to operate a micro business independently.</p>
<p>Once they’ve completed repayment of a portion of the capital cost of the store and met the performance criteria, the store is officially handed over to them and their new life as a fully independent entrepreneur begins.</p>
<p>They are also encouraged to start thinking about other opportunities outside their shop, such as opening up a franchised business.</p>

<p>Maryam Fish, 30, of Lansdowne, led an all-female team of researchers at the University of Cape Town, along with Gasnat Shaboodien and Sarah Krause, who made the discovery with researchers from Italy</p>
<p>Fifty years after South Africa performed the world&#8217;s first successful heart transplant, a woman from the Cape Flats has made another landmark medical discovery that could prevent hundreds of cardiac-related deaths every year.</p>
<p>The discovery of a gene that is a major cause of sudden death among under-35s is likely to put South Africa on the map in the world of genetics, showing that the country “is on par with international researchers”.</p>
<p>Maryam Fish, 30, of Lansdowne, led an all-female team of researchers at the University of Cape Town, along with Gasnat Shaboodien and Sarah Krause, who made the discovery with researchers from Italy.</p>
<p>The gene, called CDH2, is found in everyone, but a mutation causes a genetic disorder known as arrythmogenic right ventricle cardiomyopathy (ARVC), which increases the risk of heart disease and cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>Sudden cardiac death is estimated to hit more than five young people in South Africa daily, according to the Medical Research Council.</p>
<p>In under-35s an inherited form of disease of the heart muscle plays a prominent role in fatalities as a result of cardiac arrest.
“We sequenced all the genes in the human genome in two cousins who were affected,” said Fish, explaining that the cousins were identified after a 22-year-old relative died suddenly.</p>
<p>“We then looked for common variants and had a list of 13000, which we narrowed down through a series of filtering criteria until we got the CDH2 variant, which was the most likely causal variant in this family.”</p>
<p>The team then screened the gene in a number of unrelated individuals who also had ARVC.</p>
<p>This added “more evidence to our case that the CDH2 gene was the causal gene for ARVC”.</p>
<p>The soft-spoken PhD graduate comes from a family of good genes. Her father and brother are engineers, and her mother is a mathematician.</p>
<p>Fish said she felt “relieved that I managed to solve the problem after so long”, and didn&#8217;t agree with the assessment of her family&#8217;s gifted intelligence, shyly remarking that they were “just OK”.</p>
<p>Announcing the discovery yesterday, UCT dean of health Bongani Mayosi likened its importance to the first heart transplant, performed by Dr Christiaan Barnard at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town in 1967.</p>
<p>Mayosi began hunting for the gene himself as a young scientist in 1996. “Half of [people] will meet their Maker through sudden death,” he said. “This will help us understand a common problem by taking it forward to develop drugs that target this particular gene.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve taken God&#8217;s own experiment of an inherited condition to understand the causes of sudden death.”</p>
<p>Key to making the discovery was a new technique, whole
exome sequencing, which analyses every gene in a human&#8217;s DNA.
Shaboodien told Fish about the technique after finding out about it during a trip to Italy.</p>

<p>“We called it genetics on steroids. Without this technique we would not have made this discovery.”</p>
<p>Shaboodien said the discovery would help put South Africa on the map in genetics and showed “that we are capable of being on par with international researchers”.</p>
<p>The clinical importance of the discovery meant early detection of unsuspecting people with ARVC was now possible.</p>
<p>But Krause said testing for ARVC would not be easily<br />
accessible for most people, and the UCT research centre where they worked was one of the few places in South Africa where genetic screening was done.</p>
<p>“I think it&#8217;s important to understand there isn&#8217;t available [public] diagnostic screening in South Africa. In [the private sector] you can get blood sent overseas to be screened,” she said.</p>

<p>The party called Mahlangu a &#8220;killer&#8221; for being driving force to move patients from Life Esidimeni homes to unregistered NGOs. The NGOs were found to have been unsafe‚ crowded‚ without sufficient heating and without skilled staff. At least 94 people died from hunger‚ dehydration and diseases unrelated to mental health.</p>
<p>Mahlangu&#8217;s decision was described as &#8220;reckless&#8221; by health ombudsman Professor Malegapuru Makgoba.</p>
<p>Mahlangu&#8217;s resignation was announced on Wednesday by the Gauteng Premier.</p>
<p>The EFF says it will lay charges against anyone else implicated in the killing of the patients.</p>
<p>The ANC Youth League has also indicated it wishes to lay charges of murder against the former health MEC.</p>
<p>Jack Bloom of the Democratic Alliance said: &#8220;It took 141 days for Mahlangu to resign following the first disclosure of deaths in reply to my question in the Gauteng Legislature on 13 September last year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bloom continued: &#8220;Premier (David) Makhura has failed badly in this matter and needs to keep his promises to ensure that action is taken against all those implicated‚ including criminal charges.&#8221;</p>
<p>The DA&#8217;s health spokesman said Mahlangu&#8217;s replacement‚ Dr Gwen Ramokgopa‚ was a poor MEC when she was in charge.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not impressed with the return of Dr Gwen Ramokgopa as MEC of the Gauteng Health Department‚&#8221; said Bloom. &#8220;She was mediocre in this position previously and does not have the drive to fix this deeply dysfunctional department.&#8221;</p>
